Therefore, various VAD algorithms have been developed that provide varying features and compromises between latency, sensitivity, accuracy and computational cost.

The term virtual circuit is synonymous with virtual connection and virtual channel. Before a connection or virtual circuit may be used, it has to be established, between two or more nodes or software applications, by configuring the relevant parts of the interconnecting network. After that, a bit stream or byte stream may be delivered between the nodes; hence, a virtual circuit protocol allows higher level protocols to avoid dealing with the division of data into segments, packets, or frames. <br/>  <br/>Virtual circuit communication resembles circuit switching, since both are connection oriented, meaning that in both cases data is delivered in correct order, and signalling overhead is required during a connection establishment phase. However, circuit switching provides a constant bit rate and latency, while these may vary in a virtual circuit service due to factors such as: </p><ul><li><p>varying packet queue lengths in the network nodes, </p></li><li><p>varying bit rate generated by the application, </p></li><li><p>varying load from other users sharing the same network resources by means of statistical multiplexing, etc. <br/><br/>Many virtual circuit protocols, but not all, provide reliable communication service through the use of data retransmissions because of error detection and automatic repeat request (ARQ). <br/>  <br/>An alternate network configuration to virtual circuit is datagram.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="V-_Toc14450620_Toc87515535VCI"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="V-_Toc14450620"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450620"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="V-_Toc87515535"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515535"></span></span>VCI</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Virtual Channel Identifier</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The VCI, used in conjunction with the VPI (virtual path indicator), indicates where an ATM cell is to travel over a network.

Since 1987, VHDL has been standardized by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) as IEEE Std 1076; the latest version (as of April 2020) of which is IEEE Std 1076-2019. To model analog and mixed-signal systems, an IEEE-standardized HDL based on VHDL called VHDL-AMS (officially IEEE 1076.1) has been developed.</p><p>VHDL is named after the United States Department of Defense program that created it, the Very High-Speed Integrated Circuits Program (VHSIC). In the early 1980s, the VHSIC Program sought a new HDL for use in the design of the integrated circuits it aimed to develop. The product of this effort was VHDL Version 7.2, released in 1985. The effort to standardize it as an IEEE standard began in the following year.</p><p>VHDL is generally used to write text models that describe a logic circuit. Such a model is processed by a synthesis program, only if it is part of the logic design. A simulation program is used to test the logic design using simulation models to represent the logic circuits that interface to the design. This collection of simulation models is commonly called a testbench.</p><p>A VHDL simulator is typically an event-driven simulator. This means that each transaction is added to an event queue for a specific scheduled time. E.g. if a signal assignment should occur after 1 nanosecond, the event is added to the queue for time +1ns. Zero delay is also allowed, but still needs to be scheduled: for these cases delta delay is used, which represent an infinitely small time step. The simulation alters between two modes: statement execution, where triggered statements are evaluated, and event processing, where events in the queue are processed.</p><p>VHDL has constructs to handle the parallelism inherent in hardware designs, but these constructs (processes) differ in syntax from the parallel constructs in Ada (tasks). Like Ada, VHDL is strongly typed and is not case sensitive. In order to directly represent operations which are common in hardware, there are many features of VHDL which are not found in Ada, such as an extended set of Boolean operators including nand and nor.</p><p>VHDL has file input and output capabilities, and can be used as a general-purpose language for text processing, but files are more commonly used by a simulation testbench for stimulus or verification data. There are some VHDL compilers which build executable binaries. In this case, it might be possible to use VHDL to write a testbench to verify the functionality of the design using files on the host computer to define stimuli, to interact with the user, and to compare results with those expected. However, most designers leave this job to the simulator.</p><p>It is relatively easy for an inexperienced developer to produce code that simulates successfully but that cannot be synthesized into a real device, or is too large to be practical. One particular pitfall is the accidental production of transparent latches rather than D-type flip-flops as storage elements.</p><p>One can design hardware in a VHDL IDE (for FPGA implementation such as Xilinx ISE, Altera Quartus, Synopsys Synplify or Mentor Graphics HDL Designer) to produce the RTL schematic of the desired circuit. After that, the generated schematic can be verified using simulation software which shows the waveforms of inputs and outputs of the circuit after generating the appropriate testbench. To generate an appropriate testbench for a particular circuit or VHDL code, the inputs have to be defined correctly. For example, for clock input, a loop process or an iterative statement is required.</p><p>A final point is that when a VHDL model is translated into the &quot;gates and wires&quot; that are mapped onto a programmable logic device such as a CPLD or FPGA, then it is the actual hardware being configured, rather than the VHDL code being &quot;executed&quot; as if on some form of a processor chip.</p><div class="code panel pdl" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent pdl">

In this way, VLANs can keep network applications separate despite being connected to the same physical network, and without requiring multiple sets of cabling and networking devices to be deployed. <br/>  <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="233" width="478" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15009152/15009165.png?width=478" data-image-src="attachments/15009152/15009165.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15009165" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddavef3e813aaa27b707fcb13ce376f064fa.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15009152" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="7bf113c7-a0cf-4536-af55-1064d9fca698" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="V-_Toc14450625_Toc87515540VLR"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="V-_Toc14450625"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450625"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="V-_Toc87515540"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515540"></span></span>VLR</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Visitor Location Register</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The Visitor Location Register (VLR) is a database of the MSs (Mobile stations) that have roamed into the jurisdiction of the MSC (Mobile Switching Center) which it serves.

This approach results in the voice service (control and media planes) being delivered as data flows within the LTE data bearer. This means that there is no dependency on (or ultimately, requirement for) the legacy circuit-switched voice network to be maintained. VoLTE has up to three times more voice and data capacity than 3G UMTS and up to six times more than 2G GSM.

It allows geographically dispersed sites to share an Ethernet broadcast domain by connecting sites through pseudowires. The term 'sites' includes multiplicities of both servers and clients. The technologies that can be used as pseudo-wire can be Ethernet over MPLS, L2TPv3 or even GRE. There are two IETF standards track RFCs (RFC 4761 and RFC 4762) describing VPLS establishment. <br/>  <br/>VPLS is a virtual private network (VPN) technology. In contrast to L2TPv3, which allows only point-to-point layer 2 tunnels, VPLS allows any-to-any (multipoint) connectivity. <br/>  <br/>In a VPLS, the local area network (LAN) at each site is extended to the edge of the provider network. The provider network then emulates a switch or bridge to connect all of the customer LANs to create a single bridged LAN. <br/>  <br/>VPLS is designed for applications that require multipoint or broadcast access. <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="343" width="480" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15009152/15009177.png?width=480" data-image-src="attachments/15009152/15009177.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15009177" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav93ada133c525c8f954550336596043cd.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15009152" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="874b466c-8e4a-4fb5-ad4d-abb9bbf10e17" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="V-_Toc14450633_Toc87515548VPN"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="V-_Toc14450633"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450633"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="V-_Toc87515548"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515548"></span></span>VPN</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Virtual Private Network</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>A virtual private network (VPN) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network.
