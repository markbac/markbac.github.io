Designed to be concise, many of Scala's design decisions aimed to address criticisms of Java. <br/>  <br/>Scala source code is intended to be compiled to Java bytecode, so that the resulting executable code runs on a Java virtual machine. Scala provides language interoperability with Java, so that libraries written in both languages may be referenced directly in Scala or Java code. Like Java, Scala is object-oriented, and uses a curly-brace syntax reminiscent of the C programming language. Unlike Java, Scala has many features of functional programming languages like Scheme, Standard ML and Haskell, including currying, type inference, immutability, lazy evaluation, and pattern matching. It also has an advanced type system supporting algebraic data types, covariance and contravariance, higher-order types (but not higher-rank types), and anonymous types. Other features of Scala not present in Java include operator overloading, optional parameters, named parameters, and raw strings. Conversely, a feature of Java not in Scala is checked exceptions, which have proved controversial.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-_Toc14450987_Toc87515829ScaledAgile"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc14450987"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450987"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc87515829"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515829"></span></span>Scaled Agile</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>agile scaled up to large projects or programmes, for example by having multiple sub-projects, creating tranches of projects, etc.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-_Toc14450550_Toc87515465SCCP"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc14450550"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450550"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc87515465"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515465"></span></span>SCCP</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Signalling Connection Control Part</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The (SCCP) is a network layer protocol that provides extended routing, flow control, segmentation, connection-orientation, and error correction facilities in Signaling System 7 telecommunications networks.

SC-FDMA can be interpreted as a linearly precoded OFDMA scheme, in the sense that it has an additional DFT processing step preceding the conventional OFDMA processing. <br/>SC-FDMA has drawn great attention as an attractive alternative to OFDMA, especially in the uplink communications where lower peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) greatly benefits the mobile terminal in terms of transmit power efficiency and reduced cost of the power amplifier.

The work may be virtual computation elements such as threads, processes or data flows, which are in turn scheduled onto hardware resources such as processors, network links or expansion cards. <br/>  <br/>A scheduler is what carries out the scheduling activity. Schedulers are often implemented so they keep all computer resources busy (as in load balancing), allow multiple users to share system resources effectively, or to achieve a target quality of service. Scheduling is fundamental to computation itself, and an intrinsic part of the execution model of a computer system; the concept of scheduling makes it possible to have computer multitasking with a single central processing unit (CPU). <br/>  <br/>A scheduler may aim at one or more of many goals, for example: maximizing throughput (the total amount of work completed per time unit); minimizing wait time (time from work becoming enabled until the first point it begins execution on resources); minimizing latency or response time (time from work becoming enabled until it is finished in case of batch activity, or until the system responds and hands the first output to the user in case of interactive activity); or maximizing fairness (equal CPU time to each process, or more generally appropriate times according to the priority and workload of each process). In practice, these goals often conflict (e.g. throughput versus latency), thus a scheduler will implement a suitable compromise. Preference is measured by any one of the concerns mentioned above, depending upon the user's needs and objectives. <br/>  <br/>In real-time environments, such as embedded systems for automatic control in industry (for example robotics), the scheduler also must ensure that processes can meet deadlines; this is crucial for keeping the system stable. Scheduled tasks can also be distributed to remote devices across a network and managed through an administrative back end.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-_Toc14450794_Toc87515708SCM"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc14450794"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450794"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc87515708"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515708"></span></span>SCM</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>software configuration management</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>In software engineering, software configuration management (SCM or S/W CM) is the task of tracking and controlling changes in the software, part of the larger cross-disciplinary field of configuration management.[2] SCM practices include revision control and the establishment of baselines. <span style="color: rgb(123,0,82);">If</span> something goes wrong, SCM can determine what was changed and who changed it. <span style="color: rgb(123,0,82);">If</span> a configuration is working well, SCM can determine how to replicate it across many hosts.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-_Toc14450795_Toc87515709Scratch"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc14450795"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450795"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc87515709"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515709"></span></span>Scratch</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Scratch is a visual programming language and online community targeted primarily at children.

At low transmission rates data can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The method was developed to replace the plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) system for transporting large amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over the same fiber without synchronization problems. <br/>  <br/>SONET and SDH, which are essentially the same, were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications (e.g., DS1, DS3) from a variety of different sources, but they were primarily designed to support real-time, uncompressed, circuit-switched voice encoded in PCM format.[1] The primary difficulty in doing this prior to SONET/SDH was that the synchronization sources of these various circuits were different. This meant that each circuit was actually operating at a slightly different rate and with different phase. SONET/SDH allowed for the simultaneous transport of many different circuits of differing origin within a single framing protocol. SONET/SDH is not a communications protocol in itself, but a transport protocol. <br/>  <br/>Due to SONET/SDH's essential protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH was the obvious choice for transporting the fixed length Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames also known as cells. It quickly evolved mapping structures and concatenated payload containers to transport ATM connections. In other words, for ATM (and eventually other protocols such as Ethernet), the internal complex structure previously used to transport circuit-oriented connections was removed and replaced with a large and concatenated frame (such as STS-3c) into which ATM cells, IP packets, or Ethernet frames are placed.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-_Toc14450796_Toc87515710SDK"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc14450796"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450796"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc87515710"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515710"></span></span>SDK</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Software Development Kit</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>a set of programs used by a computer programmer to write application programs.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-_Toc14450555_Toc87515470SDLC"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc14450555"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450555"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc87515470"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515470"></span></span>SDLC</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Synchronous Data Link Control</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) is a computer communications protocol.

This results in wasting power on transmissions when there are no mobile units to reach, in addition to causing interference for adjacent cells using the same frequency, so called co-channel cells. Likewise, in reception, the antenna receives signals coming from all directions including noise and interference signals. By using smart antenna technology and differing spatial locations of mobile units within the cell, space-division multiple access techniques offer attractive performance enhancements. The radiation pattern of the base station, both in transmission and reception, is adapted to each user to obtain highest gain in the direction of that user. This is often done using phased array techniques. <br/>  <br/>In GSM cellular networks, the base station is aware of the distance (but not direction) of a mobile phone by use of a technique called &quot;timing advance&quot; (TA). The base transceiver station (BTS) can determine how far the mobile station (MS) is by interpreting the reported TA. This information, along with other parameters, can then be used to power down the BTS or MS, if a power control feature is implemented in the network. The power control in either BTS or MS is implemented in most modern networks, especially on the MS, as this ensures a better battery life for the MS. This is also why having a BTS close to the user results in less exposure to electromagnetic radiation.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-_Toc14450557_Toc87515472SDN"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc14450557"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450557"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc87515472"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515472"></span></span>SDN</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Software Defined Network</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Software-defined networking (SDN) technology is an approach to cloud computing that facilitates network management and enables programmatically efficient network configuration in order to improve network performance and monitoring.

&lt;!ELEMENT  meal  (appetiz?, steak, dessert?, 
                     custname, whopays)     +(drink) &gt;

&lt;!-- The plus sign after the content model followed by 
one or more elements within parentheses declares an 
&quot;inclusion&quot;. An inclusion indicates that the elements 
can appear anywhere in the element to which they are 
attached and in any of its subelements. You can have 
one or more DRINK elements any time during MEAL. --&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT  appetiz  (soup | salad) &gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT  salad    EMPTY&gt;

&lt;!ATTLIST  salad  kind   NAME   #REQUIRED 
               dressing (french | 1000isl | bluechse) #REQUIRED&gt;

&lt;!-- The declared value for the attribute DRESSING is 
called a &quot;name token group&quot;, a series of values separated 
by a vertical bar (|). They represent the only possible 
values for the attribute. the declared value NAME requires 
a value usually comprising up to 8 letters and numbers. 
REQUIRED means that one value must be specified for the 
attribute. --&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT steak   EMPTY&gt;

&lt;!ATTLIST steak cook (rare|medrare|medium) &quot;medrare&quot;
              side  (potato|fries|rice) &quot;fries&quot;&gt;

&lt;!ELEMENT  (cake|applepie)      EMPTY&gt;

&lt;!ATTLIST   cake    kind    CDATA  #REQUIRED&gt;

&lt;!-- CDATA means any letters, numbers, punctuation, 
spaces, or other special characters. This gives you 
the possibility of creating long and unique values 
for an attribute. This means you can ask for any 
cake you want; if the system doesn&#39;t recognize the 
name, you may not get it. --&gt;

&lt;!ATTLIST applepie    hot    (hot|warm|cool) #IMPLIED
                  icecream   (yes|no)        #IMPLIED

&lt;!--   IMPLIED is an equivalent for optional. The 
APPLEPIE comes the way the waiter or waitress prefers 
unless you specify otherwise. --&gt;

&lt;!-- The declared value for WATER is fixed by the 
system. You can order any kind of fancy water you 
want, but all they&#39;ve got here is tap water. --&gt;

&lt;!ATTLIST beer   number  NUMBER        #REQUIRED&gt;

&lt;!ATTLIST cola   type    (regular | diet) #CURRENT&gt;

&lt;!-- Beer is ordered by NUMBER from the beer list. 
The Default Value CURRENT says that the first time 
the element COLA appears, a type must be specified. 
That value will be used for the next occurrences 
unless you specify another. In other words, you 
don&#39;t have to re-specify the type of COLA every 
time you ask for a refill.--&gt;

&lt;!ATTLIST  whopays       charge     IDREF   #REQUIRED&gt;

&lt;!-- The customer&#39;s name is not critical data within 
the content of the element CUSTNAME: The cashier could 
make a typo or use a nickname and the computer would 
have difficulty tracking the charge. Instead a unique 
identifier is requested - but only if the customer has 
an account. However, WHOPAYS has a required IDREF. The 
system knows that WHOPAYS may have the same value for 
many people&#39;s meals (when someone buys for the whole 
table) but each CUSTNAME will have a unique ID. The 
system will check that the value of the IDREF will be 
a legitimate ID. The example below illustrates only 
one of several MEALS in the LUNCH. A separate MEAL in 
the same LUNCH must include a CUSTNAME with an 
ACCOUNTID of &quot;ALEXF&quot; for the CHARGE IDREF to work --&gt;</pre>

It is also possible to store contact information on many SIM cards. SIM cards are always used on GSM phones; for CDMA phones, they are only needed for newer LTE-capable handsets. SIM cards can also be used in satellite phones, smart watches, computers, or cameras. <br/>  <br/>The SIM circuit is part of the function of a universal integrated circuit card (UICC) physical smart card, which is usually made of PVC with embedded contacts and semiconductors. SIM cards are transferable between different mobile devices. The first UICC smart cards were the size of credit and bank cards; sizes were reduced several times over the years, usually keeping electrical contacts the same, so that a larger card could be cut down to a smaller size. <br/>  <br/>A SIM card contains its unique serial number (ICCID), international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) number, security authentication and ciphering information, temporary information related to the local network, a list of the services the user has access to, and two passwords: a personal identification number (PIN) for ordinary use, and a personal unblocking code (PUC) for PIN unlocking. <br/>  <br/>SIM cards have been made smaller over the years; functionality is independent of format. Full-size SIM were followed by mini-SIM, micro-SIM, and nano-SIM.

SIP is a text-based protocol, incorporating many elements of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).[1] A call established with SIP may consist of multiple media streams, but no separate streams are required for applications, such as text messaging, that exchange data as payload in the SIP message. <br/>  <br/>SIP works in conjunction with several other protocols that specify and carry the session media. Media type and parameter negotiation and media setup is performed with the Session Description Protocol (SDP), which is carried as payload in SIP messages. SIP is designed to be independent of the underlying transport layer protocol, and can be used with the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP). For the transmission of media streams (voice, video) SIP typically employs the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) or the Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP).

Most multiprocessor systems today use an SMP architecture. In the case of multi-core processors, the SMP architecture applies to the cores, treating them as separate processors. <br/>  <br/>Professor John D. Kubiatowicz considers traditionally SMP systems to contain processors without caches. Culler and Pal-Singh in their 1998 book &quot;Parallel Computer Architecture: A Hardware/Software Approach&quot; mention: &quot;The term SMP is widely used but causes a bit of confusion. [...] The more precise description of what is intended by SMP is a shared memory multiprocessor where the cost of accessing a memory location is the same for all processors; that is, it has uniform access costs when the access actually is to memory. If the location is cached, the access will be faster. but cache access times and memory access times are the same on all processors.&quot; <br/>  <br/>SMP systems are tightly coupled multiprocessor systems with a pool of homogeneous processors running independently of each other. Each processor, executing different programs and working on different sets of data, has the capability of sharing common resources (memory, I/O device, interrupt system and so on) that are connected using a system bus or a crossbar. <br/>  <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="308" width="480" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008935/15008990.png?width=480" data-image-src="attachments/15008935/15008990.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008990" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav91508a5a958378776c336871c3cb87f8.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008935" data-linked-resource-container-version="8" data-media-id="210b3006-c019-44ee-9848-e191b534bf89" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-_Toc14450574_Toc87515489SMPF"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc14450574"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450574"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc87515489"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515489"></span></span>SMPF</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Shared Metallic Path Facility</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>A copper pair to the exchange that goes to two telcos, one for telephone service and one for broadband.

More recent versions, SNMPv2c and SNMPv3, feature improvements in performance, flexibility and security. <br/>  <br/>SNMP is a component of the Internet Protocol Suite as defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

Most landline calls are routed by purpose-built electronic hardware; however, soft switches using general purpose servers and VoIP technology are becoming more popular.[1] <br/>  <br/>Many telecommunications networks now make use of combinations of softswitches and more traditional purpose-built hardware. <br/>  <br/>Although the term softswitch technically refers to any such device, it is more conventionally applied to a device that handles IP-to-IP phone calls, while the phrase &quot;access server&quot; or &quot;media gateway&quot; is used to refer to devices that either originate or terminate traditional &quot;land line&quot; (hard wired) phone calls. In practice, such devices can often do both. As a practical distinction, a Skype-to-Skype phone call is entirely IP (internet) based, and so uses a softswitch somewhere in the middle connecting the calling party with the called party. In contrast, access servers might take a mobile call or a call originating from a traditional phone line, convert it to IP traffic, then send it over the internet to another such device, which terminates the call by reversing the process and converting the Voice over IP call back to older circuit switched digital systems using traditional digital ISDN / PSTN protocols that transmit voice traffic using non-IP systems. <br/>  <br/>The Call Agent takes care of functions such as billing, call routing, signaling, call services and the like, supplying the functional logic to accomplish these telephony meta-tasks. A call agent may control several different media gateways in geographically dispersed areas via a TCP/IP link. It is also used to control the functions of media gateway, in order to connect with media as well as other interfaces. This procedure is utilized to keep the interfaces clear as crystal for receiving calls from any phone lines.[2] <br/>  <br/>The softswitch generally resides in a building owned by the telephone company called a telephone exchange (UK/IRL/AUS/NZ) or central office (US/CAN). The central office or telephone exchange has high capacity connections to carry calls to other offices owned by the telecommunication company and to other telecommunication companies via the PSTN. <br/>  <br/>Looking towards the end users from the switch, the softswitch may be connected to several access devices via TCP/IP network. These access devices can range from small and large Analog Telephone Adaptors (ATA) which provide from one to hundreds of Telephone Pairs to an Integrated Access Device (IAD), eMTA s (embedded Multimedia Terminal Adapters) using MGCP/NCS protocol over cable (VoCable) or PBX which may provide several hundred telephone connections <br/>  <br/>Note here that Analogue (ATA), PSTN telephone devices can only be reached by a softswitch that has embedded SS7 or SIGTRAN cards, software in terms of signalling AND Trunking Gateway for Voice traffic IP/TDM, TDM/IP, TDM/TDM functions. <br/>  <br/>Typically the larger access devices will be located in a building owned by the telecommunication company near to the customers they serve. Each end user can be connected to the IAD by a simple pair of copper wires. <br/>  <br/>The medium-sized devices and PBXs are most commonly used by business that locate them on their own premises, and single-line devices are mostly found at private residences. <br/>  <br/>At the turn of the 21st century with IP Multimedia Subsystem (or IMS), the Softswitch element is represented by the Media Gateway Controller (MGC) element, and the term &quot;Softswitch&quot; is rarely used in the IMS context. Rather, it is called an AGCF (Access Gateway Control Function).</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-SoftwareChangeRequest">Software Change Request</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>SCR</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>See c<em>hange request.</em></p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-SoftwareConfigurationManagement">Software Configuration Management</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>SCM</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>See <em>configuration management</em>.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-SoftwareDevelopmentPlan">Software Development Plan</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>SDP</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Sometimes used as a synonym for <em>project plan</em> on software focused projects.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-SoftwareEngineeringBodyofKnowledge">Software Engineering Body of Knowledge</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>SWEBOK</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>IEEE led industry effort to define a body of knowledge for software engineering.

At low transmission rates data can also be transferred via an electrical interface. The method was developed to replace the plesiochronous digital hierarchy (PDH) system for transporting large amounts of telephone calls and data traffic over the same fiber without synchronization problems. <br/>  <br/>SONET and SDH, which are essentially the same, were originally designed to transport circuit mode communications (e.g., DS1, DS3) from a variety of different sources, but they were primarily designed to support real-time, uncompressed, circuit-switched voice encoded in PCM format.[1] The primary difficulty in doing this prior to SONET/SDH was that the synchronization sources of these various circuits were different. This meant that each circuit was actually operating at a slightly different rate and with different phase. SONET/SDH allowed for the simultaneous transport of many different circuits of differing origin within a single framing protocol. SONET/SDH is not a communications protocol in itself, but a transport protocol. <br/>  <br/>Due to SONET/SDH's essential protocol neutrality and transport-oriented features, SONET/SDH was the obvious choice for transporting the fixed length Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) frames also known as cells. It quickly evolved mapping structures and concatenated payload containers to transport ATM connections. In other words, for ATM (and eventually other protocols such as Ethernet), the internal complex structure previously used to transport circuit-oriented connections was removed and replaced with a large and concatenated frame (such as STS-3c) into which ATM cells, IP packets, or Ethernet frames are placed.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="S-_Toc14450810_Toc87515723SourceCode"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc14450810"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450810"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="S-_Toc87515723"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515723"></span></span>Source Code</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>In computing, source code is any collection of code, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as plain text.

It also performs number translation, local number portability, prepaid billing, Short Message Service (SMS), and other mass market services. <br/>  <br/>In North America it is often referred to as CCSS7, abbreviated for Common Channel Signaling System 7. In the United Kingdom, it is called C7 (CCITT number 7), number 7 and CCIS7 (Common Channel Interoffice Signaling 7). In Germany, it is often called ZZK-7 (Zentraler ZeichengabeKanal Nummer 7). <br/>  <br/>The only international SS7 protocol is defined by ITU-T's Q.700-series recommendations in 1988.[1] Of the many national variants of the SS7 protocols, most are based on variants of the international protocol as standardized by ANSI and ETSI. National variants with striking characteristics are the Chinese and Japanese (TTC) national variants. <br/>  <br/>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) has defined the SIGTRAN protocol suite that impinaplements levels 2, 3, and 4 protocols compatible with SS7. Sometimes also called Pseudo SS7, it is layered on the Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) transport mechanism. <br/>  <br/>SS7 protocol suite <br/>  <br/>The SS7 protocol stack may be partially mapped to the OSI Model of a packetized digital protocol stack. OSI layers 1 to 3 are provided by the Message Transfer Part (MTP) and the Signalling Connection Control Part (SCCP) of the SS7 protocol (together referred to as the Network Service Part (NSP)); for circuit related signaling, such as the BT IUP, Telephone User Part (TUP), or the ISDN User Part (ISUP), the User Part provides layer 7. Currently there are no protocol components that provide OSI layers 4 through 6.[1] The Transaction Capabilities Application Part (TCAP) is the primary SCCP User in the Core Network, using SCCP in connectionless mode. SCCP in connection oriented mode provides transport layer for air interface protocols such as BSSAP and RANAP. TCAP provides transaction capabilities to its Users (TC-Users), such as the Mobile Application Part, the Intelligent Network Application Part and the CAMEL Application Part.[citation needed] <br/>  <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="360" width="480" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008935/15009026.png?width=480" data-image-src="attachments/15008935/15009026.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15009026" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav781219d25401bb82022faf3abf342ded.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008935" data-linked-resource-container-version="8" data-media-id="e6b024b1-6d7a-4474-8534-f8ff1973959b" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/>  <br/>  <br/>The Message Transfer Part (MTP) covers a portion of the functions of the OSI network layer including: network interface, information transfer, message handling and routing to the higher levels.

Spanning tree also allows a network design to include backup links to provide fault tolerance if an active link fails. <br/>  <br/>As the name suggests, STP creates a spanning tree within a network of connected layer-2 bridges, and disables those links that are not part of the spanning tree, leaving a single active path between any two network nodes. STP is based on an algorithm that was invented by Radia Perlman while she was working for Digital Equipment Corporation. <br/>  <br/>In 2001, the IEEE introduced Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP) as 802.1w. RSTP provides significantly faster recovery in response to network changes or failures, introducing new convergence behaviors and bridge port roles to do this.

Many of these switches reside all over the United Kingdom. Concentrators are usually kept in local telephone exchanges but can be housed remotely in less populated areas. DLEs and DMSUs operate in major towns and cities and provide call routing functions. <br/>  <br/>Concentrator unit <br/>The concentrator unit consists of four main sub-systems, line modules, digital concentrator switch, digital line termination (DLT) units and control unit. Its purpose is to convert speech from analogue signals to digital format and concentrate the traffic for onward transmission to the digital local exchange (DLE). It also receives dialled information from the subscriber and passes this to the DLE, so that the call can be routed to its destination. In normal circumstances, it does not switch signals between subscriber lines but has limited capacity to do this if the connection to the DLE is lost. <br/>  <br/>Digital local exchange <br/>The Digital Local Exchange (DLE) connects to the concentrator and routes calls to different DLEs or DMSUs depending on the destination of the call. The heart of the DLE is the Digital Subscriber Switching Subsystem (DSSS) which consists of Time Switches and a Space Switch. Incoming traffic on the 30 channel PCM highways from the Concentrator Units is connected to Time Switches. The purpose of these is to take any incoming individual Time Slot and connect it to an outgoing Time Slot and so perform a switching and routing function. <br/>  <br/>Digital main switching unit <br/>The Digital Main Switching Unit (DMSU) deals with calls that have been routed by DLEs or another DMSU and is a 'trunk switch', i.e. it is not connected to any concentrators. As with DLEs, DMSUs are made up of a Digital Switching Subsystem and a Processor Utility Subsystem, amongst other things. In the British PSTN network, each DMSU is connected to every other DMSU in the country, enabling almost congestion-proof connectivity for calls through the network. <br/>  <br/>Replacement system <br/>Many of the switches installed during the 1980s are near to or over 30 years old and still in use within local exchanges, giving an idea of their reliability. <br/>  <br/>System X was scheduled for replacement with Next Generation softswitch equipment as part of the BT 21st Century Network (21CN) programme. Some other users of System X – in particular Jersey Telecom and Kingston Communications – replaced their circuit switched System X equipment with Marconi XCD5000 softswitches (which are the NGN replacement for System X) and Access Hub multiservice access nodes. However, the omission of Marconi from the BT 21CN supplier list, the lack of a suitable replacement softswitch to match System X reliability, and the shift in focus away from telephony onto broadband – all led to much of the System X estate being maintained. <br/> </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><br/></p>
