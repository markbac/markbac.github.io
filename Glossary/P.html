Packet capture is the process of intercepting and logging traffic. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and, if needed, decodes the packet's raw data, showing the values of various fields in the packet, and analyzes its content according to the appropriate RFC or other specifications. <br/>  <br/>A packet analyzer used for intercepting traffic on wireless networks is known as a wireless analyzer or WiFi analyzer. A packet analyzer can also be referred to as a network analyzer or protocol analyzer though these terms also have other meanings. <br/>  <br/>Capabilities <br/>On wired shared medias networks, such as Ethernet, Token Ring, and FDDI networks, depending on the network structure (hub or switch), it may be possible to capture all traffic on the network from a single machine on the network. On modern networks, traffic can be captured using a network switch with a so-called monitoring port that mirrors all packets that pass through designated ports of the switch. A network tap is an even more reliable solution than to use a monitoring port, since taps are less likely to drop packets during high traffic load. <br/>  <br/>On wireless LANs, traffic can be captured on one channel at a time, or by using multiple adapters, on several channels simultaneously. <br/>  <br/>On wired broadcast and wireless LANs, to capture unicast traffic between other machines, the network adapter capturing the traffic must be in promiscuous mode. On wireless LANs, even if the adapter is in promiscuous mode, packets not for the service set the adapter is configured for are usually ignored. To see those packets, the adapter must be in monitor mode. No special provisions are required to capture multicast traffic to a multicast group the packet analyzer is already monitoring, or broadcast traffic. <br/>  <br/>When traffic is captured, either the entire contents of packets are recorded, or just the headers are recorded. Recording just headers reduces storage requirements, and avoids some legal issues, yet often provides sufficient information to diagnose problems. <br/>  <br/>Captured information is decoded from raw digital form into a human-readable format that lets users easily review exchanged information. Protocol analyzers vary in their abilities to display and analyze data. <br/>  <br/>Some protocol analyzers can also generate traffic and thus act as the reference device. These can act as protocol testers. Such testers generate protocol-correct traffic for functional testing, and may also have the ability to deliberately introduce errors to test the DUT's ability to handle errors. <br/>  <br/>Protocol analyzers can also be hardware-based, either in probe format or, as is increasingly common, combined with a disk array. These devices record packets (or a slice of the packet) to a disk array. This allows historical forensic analysis of packets without users having to recreate any fault.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450496_Toc87515411PacketSwitched"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450496"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450496"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515411"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515411"></span></span>Packet Switched</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Packet switching is a method of grouping data which is transmitted over a digital network into packets which are made of a header and a payload.

This is in contrast to PCM encodings where quantization levels vary as a function of amplitude (as with the A-law algorithm or the μ-law algorithm).

As a policy tool, the PCRF plays a central role in next-generation networks. Unlike earlier policy engines that were added onto an existing network to enforce policy, the PCRF is a software component that operates at the network core and accesses subscriber databases and other specialized functions, such as a charging system, in a centralized manner. Because it operates in real time, the PCRF has an increased strategic significance and broader potential role than traditional policy engines. This has led to a proliferation of PCRF products since 2008. <br/>  <br/>The PCRF is the part of the network architecture that aggregates information to and from the network, operational support systems, and other sources (such as portals) in real time, supporting the creation of rules and then automatically making policy decisions for each subscriber active on the network. Such a network might offer multiple services, quality of service (QoS) levels, and charging rules. PCRF can provide a network agnostic solution (wire line and wireless) and can also enable multi-dimensional approach which helps in creating a lucrative and innovative platform for operators. PCRF can also be integrated with different platforms like billing, rating, charging, and subscriber database or can also be deployed as a standalone entity. <br/>  <br/>PCRF plays a key role in VoLTE as a mediator of network resources for the IP Multimedia Systems network for establishing the calls and allocating the requested bandwidth to the call bearer with configured attributes.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450502_Toc87515417PCS"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450502"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450502"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515417"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515417"></span></span>PCS</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Physical Coding Sub-layer</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The Physical Coding Sublayer (PCS) is a networking protocol sublayer in the Fast Ethernet, Gigabit Ethernet, and 10 Gigabit Ethernet standards.

By analogy, any two watches are nominally running at the same rate, clocking up 60 seconds every minute. However, there is no link between watches to guarantee that they run at exactly the same rate, and it is highly likely that one is running slightly faster than the other.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450505_Toc87515420PDU"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450505"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450505"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515420"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515420"></span></span>PDU</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Protocol Data Unit</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>In telecommunications, a protocol data unit (PDU) is information that is transmitted as a single unit among peer entities of a computer network.

A layer lower in the Internet Protocol Suite, at the Internet Layer, the PDU is called a packet, irrespective of its payload type. <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="195" width="480" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008751/15008770.png?width=480" data-image-src="attachments/15008751/15008770.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008770" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav3457a1b5ea6858c1f03ce6b3c2680c9b.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008751" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="73d02d86-2bd5-4059-999f-e453f7089b53" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450506_Toc87515421PEAP"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450506"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450506"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515421"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515421"></span></span>PEAP</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol, also known as Protected EAP or simply PEAP, is a protocol that encapsulates the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP) within an encrypted and authenticated Transport Layer Security (TLS) tunnel.

The test is performed to identify both weaknesses (also referred to as vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthorized parties to gain access to the system's features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed. <br/>  <br/>The process typically identifies the target systems and a particular goal—then reviews available information and undertakes various means to attain the goal. A penetration test target may be a white box (which provides background and system information) or black box (which provides only basic or no information except the company name). A penetration test can help determine whether a system is vulnerable to attack if the defenses were sufficient, and which defenses (if any) the test defeated. <br/>  <br/>Security issues that the penetration test uncovers should be reported to the system owner. Penetration test reports may also assess potential impacts to the organization and suggest countermeasures to reduce risk. <br/>  <br/>The goals of a penetration test vary depending on the type of approved activity for any given engagement with the primary goal focused on finding vulnerabilities that could be exploited by a nefarious actor and informing the client of those vulnerabilities along with recommended mitigation strategies. <br/>  <br/>Penetration tests are a component of a full security audit. For example, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard requires penetration testing on a regular schedule, and after system changes. <br/>  <br/>Flaw hypothesis methodology is a systems analysis and penetration prediction technique where a list of hypothesized flaws in a software system are compiled through analysis of the specifications and documentation for the system. The list of hypothesized flaws is then prioritized on the basis of the estimated probability that a flaw actually exists, and on the ease of exploiting it to the extent of control or compromise. The prioritized list is used to direct the actual testing of the system.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450508_Toc87515423PER"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450508"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450508"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515423"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515423"></span></span>PER</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Packed Encoding Rules</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Packed Encoding Rules (PER) are ASN.1 encoding rules for producing a compact transfer syntax for data structures described in ASN.1, defined in 1994. <br/>  <br/>This Recommendation or International Standard describes a set of encoding rules that can be applied to values of all ASN.1 types to achieve a much more compact representation than that achieved by the BER and its derivatives (described in ITU-T Rec.

The compactness requires that the decoder knows the complete abstract syntax of the data structure to be decoded, however. <br/>  <br/>There are two variations of packed encoding rules: unaligned and aligned. With the unaligned encoding, the bits are packed with no regard for octet (byte) boundaries. With aligned encoding, certain types of data structures are aligned on octet boundaries, meaning there may be some number of wasted padding bits. Unaligned encoding uses the least number of bits, but presumably at some cost in processing time.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-Performance">Performance</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>May be used to describe the combination of <em>feature</em> and <em>quality</em> a <em>system</em> has (or that a <em>project</em> delivers). <br/>Also used in relation to the level of support for various non-functional system requirements such as speed, resource usage, reliability, availability, etc.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450766_Toc87515680Perl"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450766"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450766"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515680"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515680"></span></span>Perl</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Perl is a family of two high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages, Perl 5 and Perl 6. <br/>  <br/>Though Perl is not officially an acronym, there are various backronyms in use, including &quot;Practical Extraction and Reporting Language&quot;. Perl was originally developed by Larry Wall in 1987 as a general-purpose Unix scripting language to make report processing easier. Since then, it has undergone many changes and revisions. Perl 6, which began as a redesign of Perl 5 in 2000, eventually evolved into a separate language. Both languages continue to be developed independently by different development teams and liberally borrow ideas from one another. <br/>  <br/>The Perl languages borrow features from other programming languages including C, shell script (sh), AWK, and sed; Wall also alludes to Basic and Lisp in the introduction to Learning Perl (Schwartz &amp; Christiansen) and so on. They provide text processing facilities without the arbitrary data-length limits of many contemporary Unix commandline tools, facilitating manipulation of text files. Perl 5 gained widespread popularity in the late 1990s as a CGI scripting language, in part due to its then unsurpassed regular expression and string parsing abilities.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450971_Toc87515813Personas"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450971"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450971"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515813"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515813"></span></span>Personas</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Personas are synthetic biographies of fictitious users of the future product.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-Perspective">Perspective</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>During an <em>inspection</em>, an assigned focus used to increase the likelihood that each inspector will find unique issues or to focus attention an particular aspects of an artifact.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450972_Toc87515814PERTchart"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450972"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450972"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515814"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515814"></span></span>PERT chart</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The program (or project) evaluation and review technique, commonly abbreviated PERT, is a statistical tool, used in project management, which was designed to analyze and represent the tasks involved in completing a given project. <br/>  <br/>First developed by the United States Navy in the 1950s, it is commonly used in conjunction with the critical path method (CPM). <br/>  <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="189" width="309" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008751/15008782.png?width=309" data-image-src="attachments/15008751/15008782.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008782" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav0c46c85e59e3c21806373cacc8513e91.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008751" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="905ac92c-4694-4852-b227-3195b2059545" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450767_Toc87515681PGP"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450767"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450767"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515681"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515681"></span></span><span style="color: rgb(46,117,181);">PGP</span></h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Pretty Good Privacy</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is an encryption program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication <span style="color: rgb(123,0,82);">for</span> data communication.

There are several different types; the simplest is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency oscillator and a phase detector in a feedback loop. The oscillator generates a periodic signal, and the phase detector compares the phase of that signal with the phase of the input periodic signal, adjusting the oscillator to keep the phases matched. <br/>  <br/>Keeping the input and output phase in lock step also implies keeping the input and output frequencies the same. Consequently, in addition to synchronizing signals, a phase-locked loop can track an input frequency, or it can generate a frequency that is a multiple of the input frequency.

A 2005 networking book noted that &quot;Most DSL providers use PPPoE, which provides authentication, encryption, and compression.&quot; Typical use of PPPoE involves leveraging the PPP facilities for authenticating the user with a username and password, predominately via the PAP protocol and less often via CHAP.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450515_Toc87515430PPTP"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450515"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450515"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515430"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515430"></span></span>PPTP</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) is an obsolete method for implementing virtual private networks, with many known security issues.

However, the most common PPTP implementation shipping with the Microsoft Windows product families implements various levels of authentication and encryption natively as standard features of the Windows PPTP stack. The intended use of this protocol is to provide security levels and remote access levels comparable with typical VPN products. <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="254" width="474" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008751/15008806.png?width=474" data-image-src="attachments/15008751/15008806.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008806" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav6f5c57e8d4134b408cd2539d17bc0f3f.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008751" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="8519c973-2739-4833-b8fb-815a2a33ad9e" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="P-_Toc14450773_Toc87515687Preemption"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc14450773"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450773"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="P-_Toc87515687"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515687"></span></span>Preemption</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>In computing, preemption is the act of temporarily interrupting a task being carried out by a computer system, without requiring its cooperation, and with the intention of resuming the task at a later time.

Languages can be classified into multiple paradigms. <br/>  <br/>Some paradigms are concerned mainly with implications for the execution model of the language, such as allowing side effects, or whether the sequence of operations is defined by the execution model. Other paradigms are concerned mainly with the way that code is organized, such as grouping a code into units along with the state that is modified by the code. Yet others are concerned mainly with the style of syntax and grammar. <br/>  <br/>Common programming paradigms include: <br/>  </p><ul><li><p>imperative which allows side effects, <br/></p><ul><li><p>object-oriented which groups code together with the state the code modifies, </p></li><li><p>procedural which groups code into functions, </p></li></ul></li><li><p>declarative which does not state the order in which operations execute, <br/></p><ul><li><p>functional which disallows side effects, </p></li><li><p>logic which has a particular style of execution model coupled to a particular style of syntax and grammar, and </p></li></ul></li><li><p>symbolic programming which has a particular style of syntax and grammar. <br/><br/>  <br/>For example, languages that fall into the imperative paradigm have two main features: they state the order in which operations occur, with constructs that explicitly control that order, and they allow side effects, in which state can be modified at one point in time, within one unit of code, and then later read at a different point in time inside a different unit of code. The communication between the units of code is not explicit. Meanwhile, in object-oriented programming, code is organized into objects that contain state that is only modified by the code that is part of the object. Most object-oriented languages are also imperative languages. In contrast, languages that fit the declarative paradigm do not state the order in which to execute operations. Instead, they supply a number of operations that are available in the system, along with the conditions under which each is allowed to execute. The implementation of the language's execution model tracks which operations are free to execute and chooses the order on its own.

It is a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible with previous versions. However, many of its major features have been backported to the Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series, and releases of Python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3 <br/> </p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><br/></p>
