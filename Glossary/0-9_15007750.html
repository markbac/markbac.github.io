It first commenced service in Seneca, Illinois on 25 March 1982, and was destined to replace the Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS and 1AESS) and other electromechanical systems in the 1980s and 1990s. The 5ESS was also used as a Class 4 telephone switch or as a hybrid Class 4/Class 5 switch in markets too small for the 4ESS. Approximately half of all US central offices are served by 5ESS switches. The 5ESS is also exported internationally, and manufactured outside the US under license. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>The 5ESS technology was transferred to the AT&amp;T Network Systems division upon the breakup of the Bell System. The division was divested by AT&amp;T as Lucent Technologies, and after becoming Alcatel-Lucent, it was acquired by Nokia. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>The 5ESS switch has three main types of modules: the Administrative Module (AM) contains the central computers; the Communications Module (CM) is the central time-divided switch of the system; and the Switching Module (SM) makes up the majority of the equipment in most exchanges. The SM performs multiplexing, analog and digital coding, and other work to interface with external equipment. Each has a controller, a small computer with duplicated CPUs and memories, like most common equipment of the exchange, for redundancy. Distributed systems lessen the load on the Central Administrative Module (AM) or main computer.</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><div class="content-wrapper"><h1 id="id-0-9-5G">5G</h1></div></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>5G is a marketing term for some new mobile technologies.

The more recent 3GPP standard includes any network using the NR New Radio software. 5G New Radio can include lower frequencies, from 600 MHz to 6 GHz. However, the speeds in these lower frequencies are only modestly higher than new 4G systems, estimated at 15% to 50% faster.

The base version of the standard was released in 1997 and has had subsequent amendments.
