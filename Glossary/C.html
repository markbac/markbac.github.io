A CA acts as a trusted third party—trusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate. The format of these certificates is specified by the X.509 standard. <br/>  <br/>One particularly common use for certificate authorities is to sign certificates used in HTTPS, the secure browsing protocol for the World Wide Web.

By analogy with the title case rules, the natural camel case rendering would have the abbreviation all in uppercase, namely &quot;oldHTMLFile&quot;. However, this approach is problematic when two acronyms occur together (e.g., &quot;parse DBM XML&quot; would become &quot;parseDBMXML&quot;) or when the standard mandates lower camel case but the name begins with an abbreviation (e.g. &quot;SQL server&quot; would become &quot;sQLServer&quot;). <span style="color: rgb(123,0,82);">For</span> this reason, some programmers prefer to treat abbreviations as <span style="color: rgb(123,0,82);">if</span> they were lowercase words and write &quot;oldHtmlFile&quot;, &quot;parseDbmXml&quot; or &quot;sqlServer&quot;.

The extent to which the goals have been accomplished is an indicator of how much capability the organization has established at that maturity level. The goals signify the scope, boundaries, and intent of each key process area.</p></li><li><p>Common Features: common features include practices that implement and institutionalize a key process area. There are five types of common features: commitment to perform, ability to perform, activities performed, measurement and analysis, and verifying implementation.</p></li><li><p>Key Practices: The key practices describe the elements of infrastructure and practice that contribute most effectively to the implementation and institutionalization of the area. <br/><br/>Levels <br/>There are five levels defined along the continuum of the model and, according to the SEI: &quot;Predictability, effectiveness, and control of an organization's software processes are believed to improve as the organization moves up these five levels. While not rigorous, the empirical evidence to date supports this belief&quot;.</p></li><li><p>Initial (chaotic, ad hoc, individual heroics) - the starting point for use of a new or undocumented repeat process.</p></li><li><p>Repeatable - the process is at least documented sufficiently such that repeating the same steps may be attempted.</p></li><li><p>Defined - the process is defined/confirmed as a standard business process</p></li><li><p>Capable - the process is quantitatively managed in accordance with agreed-upon metrics.</p></li><li><p>Efficient - process management includes deliberate process optimization/improvement. <br/><br/>Within each of these maturity levels are Key Process Areas which characterise that level, and for each such area there are five factors: goals, commitment, ability, measurement, and verification. These are not necessarily unique to CMM, representing — as they do — the stages that organizations must go through on the way to becoming mature. <br/>  <br/>The model provides a theoretical continuum along which process maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the next.

In most cases, a single 64kbit/s channel is sufficient to handle the call setup and call clear-down traffic for numerous voice and data channels. <br/>  <br/>The logical alternative to CCS is channel-associated signaling (CAS), in which each bearer channel has a signaling channel dedicated to it. <br/>  <br/>CCS offers the following advantages over CAS, in the context of the PSTN:</p><ul><li><p>Faster call set-up time</p></li><li><p>Greater trunking efficiency due to the quicker set up and clearing, thereby reducing traffic on the network</p></li><li><p>Can transfer additional information along with the signaling traffic, providing features such as caller ID</p></li><li><p>Signaling can be performed mid-call <br/><br/>  <br/>The most common CCS signaling methods in use today are Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Signalling System No. 7 (SS7). <br/>  <br/>ISDN signaling is used primarily on trunks connecting end-user private branch exchange (PBX) systems to a central office. SS7 is primarily used within the PSTN. The two signaling methods are very similar since they share a common heritage and in some cases, the same signaling messages are transmitted in both ISDN and SS7.</p></li></ul></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-CCTA">CCTA</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) was a UK government agency providing computer and telecoms support to government departments. <br/>  <br/>  <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-_Toc14450231_Toc87515146CDMA"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc14450231"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450231"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc87515146"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515146"></span></span>CDMA</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Code-division multiple access</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Code-division multiple access (CDMA) is a channel access method used by various radio communication technologies. <br/>  <br/>CDMA is an example of multiple access, where several transmitters can send information simultaneously over a single communication channel.

In digital audio transmissions, this saves bandwidth of the communications channel by transmitting nothing when the source volume is under a certain threshold, leaving only louder sounds (such as the speaker's voice) to be sent. However, improvements in background noise reduction technologies can occasionally result in the complete removal of all noise. Although maximizing call quality is of primary importance, exhaustive removal of noise may not properly simulate the typical behavior of terminals on the PSTN system. <br/>  <br/>The result of receiving total silence, especially for a prolonged period, has a number of unwanted effects on the listener, including the following: <br/>  <br/>the listener may believe that the transmission has been lost, and therefore hang up prematurely. <br/>the speech may sound &quot;choppy&quot; (see noise gate) and difficult to understand. <br/>the sudden change in sound level can be jarring to the listener. <br/>To counteract these effects, comfort noise is added, usually on the receiving end in wireless or VoIP systems, to fill in the silent portions of transmissions with artificial noise. The noise generated is at a low but audible volume level, and can vary based on the average volume level of received signals to minimize jarring transitions. <br/>  <br/>In many VoIP products, users may control how VAD and comfort noise are configured, or disable the feature entirely. <br/>  <br/>As part of the RTP audio video profile, RFC 3389 defines a standard for distributing comfort noise information in VoIP systems. <br/>  <br/>A similar concept is that of sidetone, the effect of sound that is picked up by a telephone's mouthpiece and introduced (at low level) into the earpiece of the same handset, acting as feedback.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-_Toc14450690_Toc87515604Cobol"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc14450690"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450690"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc87515604"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515604"></span></span>Cobol</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>COBOL is a compiled English-like computer programming language designed <span style="color: rgb(123,0,82);">for</span> business use.

Intended as a stopgap, the Department of Defense promptly forced computer manufacturers to provide it, resulting in its widespread adoption. It was standardized in 1968 and has since been revised four times. Expansions include support <span style="color: rgb(123,0,82);">for</span> structured and object-oriented programming. The current standard is ISO/IEC 1989:2014. <br/>  <br/>COBOL statements have an English-like syntax, which were designed to be self-documenting and highly readable. However, it is verbose and uses over 300 reserved words. In contrast with modern, succinct syntax like y = x;, COBOL has a more English-like syntax (in this case, MOVE x TO y). COBOL code is split into four divisions (identification, environment, data and procedure) containing a rigid hierarchy of sections, paragraphs and sentences. Lacking a large standard library, the standard specifies 43 statements, 87 functions and just one class.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-CodeandFixLifecycle">Code and Fix Lifecycle</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The system is started from a general concept and evolved through some combination of informal design, code, debug, and test methodologies until it is ready to release</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-_Toc14450242_Toc87515157Codecs"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc14450242"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450242"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc87515157"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515157"></span></span>Codecs</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>A codec is a device or computer program for encoding or decoding a digital data stream or signal.

Compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers. The name compiler is primarily used for programs that translate source code from a high-level programming language to a lower level language (e.g., assembly language, object code, or machine code) to create an executable program. <br/>  <br/>However, there are many different types of compilers. If the compiled program can run on a computer whose CPU or operating system is different from the one on which the compiler runs, the compiler is a cross-compiler. A bootstrap compiler is written in the language that it intends to compile. A program that translates from a low-level language to a higher level one is a decompiler. A program that translates between high-level languages is usually called a source-to-source compiler or transpiler. A language rewriter is usually a program that translates the form of expressions without a change of language. The term compiler-compiler refers to tools used to create parsers that perform syntax analysis. <br/>  <br/>A compiler is likely to perform many or all of the following operations: preprocessing, lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis (syntax-directed translation), conversion of input programs to an intermediate representation, code optimization and code generation. Compilers implement these operations in phases that promote efficient design and correct transformations of source input to target output. Program faults caused by incorrect compiler behavior can be very difficult to track down and work around; therefore, compiler implementers invest significant effort to ensure compiler correctness. <br/>  <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="122" width="698" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15007881/15007906.png?width=698" data-image-src="attachments/15007881/15007906.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15007906" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav1a01966a1fd7dac73a19b8325d61429d.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15007881" data-linked-resource-container-version="5" data-media-id="f09fb4be-6f60-4e06-9d20-123fc78bba59" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-Component">Component</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Software component.

The source code files will usually contain a copy of the license terms and acknowledge the authors. <br/>  <br/>Copyleft type licenses are a novel use of existing copyright law to ensure a work remains freely available. The GNU General Public License (GPL), originally written by Richard Stallman, was the first software copyleft license to see extensive use, and continues to dominate in that area. Creative Commons, a non-profit organization founded by Lawrence Lessig, provides a similar license provision condition called share-alike. <br/>  <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="79" width="79" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15007881/15007924.png?width=79" data-image-src="attachments/15007881/15007924.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15007924" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav4534c211b42554dcae7cc5dd2f35f098.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15007881" data-linked-resource-container-version="5" data-media-id="f4f5450c-482b-48bf-b143-827828e05431" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/>  <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-CorrectiveActivityManagement">Corrective Activity Management</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>CAM</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The management of identified c<em>hange requests</em>, <em>defects</em>, <em>risks</em>, and <em>issues</em>. <br/>CAM is a CxOne abstraction allowing reuse of materials and processes for the management of project work not explicitly identified in the project plan.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-_Toc14450246_Toc87515161CoS"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc14450246"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450246"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc87515161"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515161"></span></span>CoS</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Class of Service</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Class of service is a parameter used in data and voice protocols to differentiate the types of payloads contained in the packet being transmitted.

A related term, Mil-COTS, refers to COTS products for use by the U.S. military. <br/>  <br/>In the context of the U.S. government, the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) has defined &quot;COTS&quot; as a formal term for commercial items, including services, available in the commercial marketplace that can be bought and used under government contract. For example, Microsoft is a COTS software provider. Goods and construction materials may qualify as COTS but bulk cargo does not. Services associated with the commercial items may also qualify as COTS, including installation services, training services, and cloud services. <br/>  <br/>COTS purchases are alternatives to custom software or one-off developments – government-funded developments or otherwise. <br/>  <br/>Although COTS products can be used out of the box, in practice the COTS product must be configured to achieve the needs of the business and integrated to existing organizational systems. Extending the functionality of COTS products via custom development is also an option, however this decision should be carefully considered due to the long term support and maintenance implications. Such customized functionality is not supported by the COTS vendor, so brings its own sets of issues when upgrading the COTS product.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-_Toc14450247_Toc87515162CPE"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc14450247"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450247"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc87515162"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515162"></span></span>CPE</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Customer Premise Equipment</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Customer-premises equipment or customer-provided equipment (CPE) is any terminal and associated equipment located at a subscriber's premises and connected with a carrier's telecommunication circuit at the demarcation point <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="257" width="481" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15007881/15007930.png?width=481" data-image-src="attachments/15007881/15007930.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15007930" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav35f675b122635d889586c86922cb22a9.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15007881" data-linked-resource-container-version="5" data-media-id="69a483ce-9f53-4e2c-9ef1-1ede4b88010d" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-_Toc14450935_Toc87515777CPM"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc14450935"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450935"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc87515777"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515777"></span></span>CPM</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>critical path method</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The critical path method (CPM), or critical path analysis (CPA), is an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities.[1] It is commonly used in conjunction with the program evaluation and review technique (PERT).</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="C-_Toc14450248_Toc87515163CPS"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc14450248"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450248"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="C-_Toc87515163"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515163"></span></span>CPS</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Carrier Pre-Select</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Carrier preselect is a term relating to the telecommunications industry.

It is a delta modulation with variable step size (i.e., special case of adaptive delta modulation), first proposed by Greefkes and Riemens in 1970. <br/>  <br/>CVSD encodes at 1 bit per sample, so that audio sampled at 16 kHz is encoded at 16 kbit/s. <br/>  <br/>The encoder maintains a reference sample and a step size. Each input sample is compared to the reference sample. If the input sample is larger, the encoder emits a 1 bit and adds the step size to the reference sample. If the input sample is smaller, the encoder emits a 0 bit and subtracts the step size from the reference sample. The encoder also keeps the previous N bits of output (N = 3 or N = 4 are very common) to determine adjustments to the step size; if the previous N bits are all 1s or 0s, the step size is increased. Otherwise, the step size is decreased (usually in an exponential manner, with {\displaystyle \tau } \tau being in the range of 5 ms). The step size is adjusted for every input sample processed. <br/>  <br/>To allow for bit errors to fade out and to allow (re)synchronization to an ongoing bitstream, the output register (which keeps the reference sample) is normally realized as a leaky integrator with a time constant ( {\displaystyle \tau } \tau ) of about 1 ms. <br/>  <br/>The decoder reverses this process, starting with the reference sample, and adding or subtracting the step size according to the bit stream. The sequence of adjusted reference samples are the reconstructed waveform, and the step size is adjusted according to the same all-1s-or-0s logic as in the encoder. <br/>  <br/>Adaptation of step size allows one to avoid slope overload (step of quantization increases when the signal rapidly changes) and decreases granular noise when the signal is constant (decrease of step of quantisation). <br/>  <br/>CVSD is sometimes called a compromise between simplicity, low bitrate, and quality. Common bitrates are 9.6–128 kbit/s. <br/>  <br/>Like other delta-modulation techniques, the output of the decoder does not exactly match the original input to the encoder.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><br/></p>
