The final standard was approved by the IEEE in June 2008 as IEEE 802.1ah-2008 and has been integrated into IEEE 802.1Q-2011. <br/>  <br/>The idea of PBB is to offer complete separation of customer and provider domains. For this purpose, a new Ethernet header has been defined. This header may take multiple different forms, but the main components of the header are: <br/>  </p><ul><li><p>Backbone component, that has: </p></li><li><p>Backbone destination address (B-DA) (six bytes) </p></li><li><p>Backbone source address (B-SA) (six bytes) </p></li><li><p>EtherType 0x88A8 (two bytes) </p></li><li><p>B-TAG/B-VID (two bytes), this is the backbone VLAN indicator </p></li><li><p>Service encapsulation, that has: </p></li><li><p>EtherType 0x88E7 (two bytes) </p></li><li><p>Flags that contain priority, Drop Eligible Indicator (DEI) and No Customer Address (NCA) indication (e.g. OAM frames). </p></li><li><p>I-SID, the service identifier (three bytes) </p></li><li><p>Original customer frame </p></li><li><p>Customer destination address (six bytes) </p></li><li><p>Customer source address (six bytes) </p></li><li><p>EtherType 0x8100 (two bytes) </p></li><li><p>Customer VLAN identifier (two bytes) </p></li><li><p>EtherType (e.g. 0x0800) </p></li><li><p>Customer payload <br/><br/>PBB defines a 48 bit B-DA and 48 bit B-SA to indicate the backbone source and destination MAC addresses. It also defines a 12 bit B-VID (backbone VLAN ID) and 24 bit I-SID (Service Instance VLAN ID). The bridges in the PBB domain switch based on the B-VID and B-DA values, which contain 60 bits total. Bridges learn based on the B-SA and ingress port value and hence is completely unaware of the customer MAC addresses.

It was formerly freeware with limitations on commercial use, but since 2011 it is available under a free software/open source (3-clause BSD license) license as a part of the open source WebRTC project. It is suitable for VoIP applications, streaming audio, archival and messaging. The algorithm is a version of block-independent linear predictive coding, with the choice of data frame lengths of 20 and 30 milliseconds. The encoded blocks have to be encapsulated in a suitable protocol for transport, usually the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). <br/>  <br/>iLBC handles lost frames through graceful speech quality degradation. Lost frames often occur in connection with lost or delayed IP packets. Ordinary low-bitrate codecs exploit dependencies between speech frames, which cause errors to propagate when packets are lost or delayed. In contrast, iLBC-encoded speech frames are independent and so this problem will not occur.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="I-_Toc14450371_Toc87515286iManager"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc14450371"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450371"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc87515286"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515286"></span></span>iManager</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Huawei MSAN and DSLAM management tool</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="I-_Toc14450372_Toc87515287IMAP"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc14450372"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450372"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc87515287"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515287"></span></span>IMAP</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Internet Message Access Protocol</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>In computing, the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) is an Internet standard protocol used by email clients to retrieve email messages from a mail server over a TCP/IP connection.

Historically, mobile phones have provided voice call services over a circuit-switched-style network, rather than strictly over an IP packet-switched network. Alternative methods of delivering voice (VoIP) or other multimedia services have become available on smartphones, but they have not become standardized across the industry. IMS is an architectural framework to provide such standardization. <br/>  <br/>IMS was originally designed by the wireless standards body 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), as a part of the vision for evolving mobile networks beyond GSM. Its original formulation (3GPP Rel-5) represented an approach for delivering Internet services over GPRS. This vision was later updated by 3GPP, 3GPP2 and ETSI TISPAN by requiring support of networks other than GPRS, such as Wireless LAN, CDMA2000 and fixed lines. <br/>  <br/>IMS uses IETF protocols wherever possible, e.g., the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP). According to the 3GPP, IMS is not intended to standardize applications, but rather to aid the access of multimedia and voice applications from wireless and wireline terminals, i.e., to create a form of fixed-mobile convergence (FMC). This is done by having a horizontal control layer that isolates the access network from the service layer. From a logical architecture perspective, services need not have their own control functions, as the control layer is a common horizontal layer. However, in implementation this does not necessarily map into greater reduced cost and complexity. <br/></p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper image-center-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image image-center" width="226" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008353/15204369.png?width=226" data-image-src="attachments/15008353/15204369.png" data-height="336" data-width="360" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15204369" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="image-20211224-152844.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008353" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="9a17a9cb-4ccb-4d5f-b695-94af5238b732" data-media-type="file"></span><p><br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="I-_Toc14450374_Toc87515289IMSI"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc14450374"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450374"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc87515289"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515289"></span></span>IMSI</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>International Mobile Subscriber Identity</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The International Mobile Subscriber Identity or IMSI is used to identify the user of a cellular network and is a unique identification associated with all cellular networks. It is stored as a 64 bit field and is sent by the phone to the network. It is also used for acquiring other details of the mobile in the home location register (HLR) or as locally copied in the visitor location register. To prevent eavesdroppers identifying and tracking the subscriber on the radio interface, the IMSI is sent as rarely as possible and a randomly generated TMSI is sent instead. <br/>  <br/>The IMSI is used in any mobile network that interconnects with other networks. For GSM, UMTS and LTE networks, this number was provisioned in the SIM card and for cdmaOne and CDMA2000 networks, in the phone directly or in the R-UIM card (the CDMA equivalent of the SIM card). Both cards have been superseded by the UICC. <br/>  <br/>An IMSI is usually presented as a 15 digit number but can be shorter. For example, MTN South Africa's old IMSIs that are still being used in the market are shown as 14 digits. The first 3 digits are the mobile country code (MCC), which are followed by the mobile network code (MNC), either 2 digits (European standard) or 3 digits (North American standard). The length of the MNC depends on the value of the MCC, and it is recommended that the length is uniform within a MCC area. The remaining digits are the mobile subscription identification number (MSIN) within the network's customer base (mostly 10 or 9 digits depending on the MNC length). <br/>  <br/>The IMSI conforms to the ITU E.212 numbering standard.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="I-_Toc14450375_Toc87515290IN"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc14450375"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450375"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc87515290"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515290"></span></span>IN</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Intelligent Network</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The Intelligent Network (IN) is the standard network architecture specified in the ITU-T Q.1200 series recommendations.

This functionality is organized into four abstraction layers, which classify all related protocols according to the scope of networking involved. From lowest to highest, the layers are the link layer, containing communication methods for data that remains within a single network segment (link); the internet layer, providing internetworking between independent networks; the transport layer, handling host-to-host communication; and the application layer, providing process-to-process data exchange for applications. <br/>  <br/>Technical standards specifying the Internet protocol suite and many of its constituent protocols are maintained by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).

The interpreter executes the program directly, translating each statement into a sequence of one or more subroutines, and then into another language (often machine code). <br/>  <br/>The terms interpreted language and compiled language are not well defined because, in theory, any programming language can be either interpreted or compiled. In modern programming language implementation, it is increasingly popular for a platform to provide both options. <br/>  <br/>Interpreted languages can also be contrasted with machine languages. Functionally, both execution and interpretation mean the same thing — fetching the next instruction/statement from the program and executing it. Although interpreted byte code is additionally identical to machine code in form and has an assembler representation, the term &quot;interpreted&quot; is practically reserved for &quot;software processed&quot; languages (by virtual machine or emulator) on top of the native (i.e. hardware) processor. <br/>  <br/>In principle, programs in many languages may be compiled or interpreted, emulated or executed natively, so this designation is applied solely based on common implementation practice, rather than representing an essential property of a language. <br/>  <br/>Many languages have been implemented using both compilers and interpreters, including BASIC, C, Lisp, Pascal, and Python.

A SIEM system combines outputs from multiple sources, and uses alarm filtering techniques to distinguish malicious activity from false alarms. <br/>  <br/>While there are several types of IDS, ranging in scope from single computers to large networks,[1]. the most common classifications are network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) and host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS). A system that monitors important operating system files is an example of a HIDS, while a system that analyzes incoming network traffic is an example of a NIDS. It is also possible to classify IDS by detection approach: the most well-known variants are signature-based detection (recognizing bad patterns, such as malware) and anomaly-based detection (detecting deviations from a model of &quot;good&quot; traffic, which often relies on machine learning). Some IDS have the ability to respond to detected intrusions. Systems with response capabilities are typically referred to as an intrusion prevention system.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="I-_Toc14450380_Toc87515295IPSC"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc14450380"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450380"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc87515295"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515295"></span></span>IPSC</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>IP Stream Connect</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="267" width="480" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008353/15008384.png?width=480" data-image-src="attachments/15008353/15008384.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008384" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav2c1cc3e24c778d99523206b0cd37c974.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008353" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="358f4cd6-3534-462f-9f5b-6911bb2be637" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="I-_Toc14450381_Toc87515296IPSec"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc14450381"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450381"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc87515296"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515296"></span></span>IPSec</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>IP Security</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>In computing, Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) is a secure network protocol suite of IPv4 that authenticates and encrypts the packets of data sent over an IPv4 network. Because of the complexity or immaturity of the IP security protocols, the initial IPv4 was developed without or barely with security protocols such that the IP version was incomplete, open or left for further research development. IPsec includes protocols for establishing mutual authentication between agents at the beginning of the session and negotiation of cryptographic keys to use during the session. IPsec can protect data flows between a pair of hosts (host-to-host), between a pair of security gateways (network-to-network), or between a security gateway and a host (network-to-host).[1] Internet Protocol security (IPsec) uses cryptographic security services to protect communications over Internet Protocol (IP) networks. IPsec supports network-level peer authentication, data-origin authentication, data integrity, data confidentiality (encryption), and replay protection. <br/>  <br/>As a part of the IPv4 enhancement, IPsec is a layer 3 OSI model or Internet Layer for an end-to-end security scheme operating in the Internet Protocol Suite in version 4, while some other Internet security systems in widespread use are above the layer 3, such as Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Secure Shell (SSH), operate in the upper layers at the Transport Layer (TLS) and the Application layer (SSH).

IPv6 was developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to deal with the long-anticipated problem of IPv4 address exhaustion. IPv6 is intended to replace IPv4. IPv6 became a Draft Standard in December 1998, and became an Internet Standard on 14 July 2017. <br/>  <br/>Every device on the Internet is assigned a unique IP address for identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4 address space had available. By 1998, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address, theoretically allowing 2128, or approximately 3.4×1038 addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are reserved for special use or completely excluded from use. The total number of possible IPv6 addresses is more than 7.9×1028 times as many as IPv4, which uses 32-bit addresses and provides approximately 4.3 billion addresses. The two protocols are not designed to be interoperable, complicating the transition to IPv6. However, several IPv6 transition mechanisms have been devised to permit communication between IPv4 and IPv6 hosts. <br/>  <br/>IPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate route aggregation across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of routing tables. The use of multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security, and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the protocol. <br/>  <br/>IPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups of four hexadecimal digits with the groups being separated by colons, for example 2001:0db8:0000:0042:0000:8a2e:0370:7334, but methods to abbreviate this full notation exist. <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="321" width="380" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008353/15008396.png?width=380" data-image-src="attachments/15008353/15008396.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008396" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav2390bf4aa4b4ee73f70256ab52f09729.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008353" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="05fa4dc4-d79c-4bf9-99fd-6496031175e6" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/>  <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="314" width="480" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008353/15008402.png?width=480" data-image-src="attachments/15008353/15008402.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008402" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddave438bb1f7247db1f07629662ee177b01.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008353" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="382c94d7-c9d0-4f5d-b0ec-b5daa3a3fcb6" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="I-_Toc14450385_Toc87515300ISDN"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc14450385"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450385"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc87515300"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515300"></span></span>ISDN</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Integrated Services Digital Network</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) is a set of communication standards for simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network services over the traditional circuits of the public switched telephone network. It was first defined in 1988 in the CCITT red book.[1] Prior to ISDN, the telephone system was viewed as a way to transport voice, with some special services available for data. The key feature of ISDN is that it integrates speech and data on the same lines, adding features that were not available in the classic telephone system. The ISDN standards define several kinds of access interfaces, such as Basic Rate Interface (BRI), Primary Rate Interface (PRI), Narrowband ISDN (N-ISDN), and Broadband ISDN (B-ISDN). <br/>  <br/>ISDN is a circuit-switched telephone network system, which also provides access to packet switched networks, designed to allow digital transmission of voice and data over ordinary telephone copper wires, resulting in potentially better voice quality than an analog phone can provide. It offers circuit-switched connections (for either voice or data), and packet-switched connections (for data), in increments of 64 kilobit/s. In some countries, ISDN found major market application for Internet access, in which ISDN typically provides a maximum of 128 kbit/s bandwidth in both upstream and downstream directions. Channel bonding can achieve a greater data rate; typically the ISDN B-channels of three or four BRIs (six to eight 64 kbit/s channels) are bonded. <br/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="247" width="480" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008353/15008408.png?width=480" data-image-src="attachments/15008353/15008408.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008408" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav040925714cf9b5e71af5bf64d054a3c0.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008353" data-linked-resource-container-version="4" data-media-id="71452f2a-8734-4bb1-a61b-1ff94d3a2ef8" data-media-type="file"></span> <br/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="I-_Toc14450386_Toc87515301ISDN2"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc14450386"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450386"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc87515301"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515301"></span></span>ISDN2 </h1><h1 id="I-_Toc14450387_Toc87515302BRI"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc14450387"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450387"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="I-_Toc87515302"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515302"></span></span>BRI</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Basic Rate Interface</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Basic Rate Interface (BRI, 2B+D, 2B1D) or Basic Rate Access is an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) configuration intended primarily for use in subscriber lines similar to those that have long been used for voice-grade telephone service.

In its current form (known as ITIL 2011), ITIL is published as a series of five core volumes, each of which covers a different ITSM lifecycle stage. Although ITIL underpins ISO/IEC 20000 (previously BS 15000), the International Service Management Standard for IT service management, there are some differences between the ISO 20000 standard, ICT Standard by IFGICT and the ITIL framework. <br/>  <br/>ITIL describes processes, procedures, tasks, and checklists which are not organization-specific or technology-specific, but can be applied by an organization for establishing integration with the organization's strategy, delivering value, and maintaining a minimum level of competency. It allows the organization to establish a baseline from which it can plan, implement, and measure. It is used to demonstrate compliance and to measure improvement.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="I-ITU">ITU</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>International Telecommunication Union</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The International Telecommunication Union (ITU; French: Union Internationale des Télécommunications (UIT)), originally the International Telegraph Union (French: Union Télégraphique Internationale), is a specialized agency of the United Nations (UN) that is responsible for issues that concern information and communication technologies.[1] <br/>  <br/>The ITU coordinates the shared global use of the radio spectrum, promotes international cooperation in assigning satellite orbits, works to improve telecommunication infrastructure in the developing world, and assists in the development and coordination of worldwide technical standards. The ITU is active in areas including broadband Internet, latest-generation wireless technologies, aeronautical and maritime navigation, radio astronomy, satellite-based meteorology, convergence in fixed-mobile phone, Internet access, data, voice, TV broadcasting, and next-generation networks. The agency also organizes worldwide and regional exhibitions and forums, such as ITU Telecom World, bringing together representatives of government and the telecommunications and ICT industry to exchange ideas, knowledge and technology.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><h1 id="I-ITU-T">ITU-T</h1></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is one of the three sectors (divisions or units) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU); it coordinates standards for telecommunications. <br/>  <br/>The standardization efforts of ITU commenced in 1865 with the formation of the International Telegraph Union (ITU).

IVR systems can respond with pre-recorded or dynamically generated audio to further direct users on how to proceed. IVR systems deployed in the network are sized to handle large call volumes and also used for outbound calling, as IVR systems are more intelligent than many predictive dialer systems</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p><br/></p>
