<td class="confluenceTd"><p>radio access network </p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>A radio access network (RAN) is part of a mobile telecommunication system. It implements a radio access technology. Conceptually, it resides between a device such as a mobile phone, a computer, or any remotely controlled machine and provides connection with its core network (CN). Depending on the standard, mobile phones and other wireless connected devices are varyingly known as user equipment (UE), terminal equipment, mobile station (MS), etc. RAN functionality is typically provided by a silicon chip residing in both the core network as well as the user equipment.  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Examples of radio access network types are: <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></p>
<ul>
	<li>GRAN: GSM radio access network <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></li>
	<li>GERAN: essentially the same as GRAN but specifying the inclusion of EDGE packet radio services <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></li>
	<li>UTRAN: UMTS radio access network <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></li>
	<li>E-UTRAN: The Long Term Evolution (LTE) high speed and low latency radio access network <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
 <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
It is also possible for a single handset/phone to be simultaneously connected to multiple radio access networks. Handsets capable of this are sometimes called dual-mode handsets. For instance it is common for handsets to support both GSM and UMTS (a.k.a. &quot;3G&quot;) radio access technologies. Such devices seamlessly transfer an ongoing call between different radio access networks without the user noticing any disruption in service. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>In telecommunications networks, RANAP (an acronym for Radio Access Network Application Part) is a protocol specified by 3GPP in TS 25.413 and used in UMTS for signaling between the Core Network, which can be a MSC or SGSN, and the UTRAN. RANAP is carried over Iu-interface. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
RANAP signalling protocol resides in the control plane of Radio network layer of Iu interface in the UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunication System) protocol stack.

  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
RANAP handles signaling for the Iu-PS - RNC and 3G SGSN and Iu-CS - RNC and 3G MSC . It also provides the signaling channel to transparently pass messages between the User Equipment (UE) and the CN. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Dynamic IP Address Allocation – Reverse Address Resolution protocol</p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>The Reverse Address Resolution Protocol (RARP) is an obsolete computer networking protocol used by a client computer to request its Internet Protocol (IPv4) address from a computer network, when all it has available is its link layer or hardware address, such as a MAC address. The client broadcasts the request and does not need prior knowledge of the network topology or the identities of servers capable of fulfilling its request. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
RARP is described in Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) publication RFC 903. It has been rendered obsolete by the Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP) and the modern Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which both support a much greater feature set than RARP. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
RARP requires one or more server hosts to maintain a database of mappings of Link Layer addresses to their respective protocol addresses. Media Access Control (MAC) addresses need to be individually configured on the servers by an administrator. RARP is limited to serving only IP addresses. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Reverse ARP differs from the Inverse Address Resolution Protocol (InARP) described in RFC 2390, which is designed to obtain the IP address associated with a local Frame Relay data link connection identifier. InARP is not used in Ethernet. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Modern Day Uses <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Although the original uses for RARP have been overcome by different protocols, some modern day protocols use RARP. Examples are: <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Cisco's Overlay Transport Virtualization (OTV). RARP is used to update the layer 2 forwarding tables when a MAC address moves between data centers.</p></td>

Relational databases have often replaced legacy hierarchical databases and network databases because they were easier to implement and administer. Nonetheless, relational databases received continued, unsuccessful challenges by object database management systems in the 1980s and 1990s, (which were introduced in an attempt to address the so-called object-relational impedance mismatch between relational databases and object-oriented application programs), as well as by XML database management systems in the 1990s. However, due to the expanse of technologies, such as horizontal scaling of computer clusters, NoSQL databases have recently become popular as an alternative to RDBMS databases <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Representational State Transfer</p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints and properties based on HTTP. Web Services that conform to the REST architectural style, or RESTful web services, provide interoperability between computer systems on the Internet. REST-compliant web services allow the requesting systems to access and manipulate textual representations of web resources by using a uniform and predefined set of stateless operations. Other kinds of web services, such as SOAP web services, expose their own arbitrary sets of operations. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
&quot;Web resources&quot; were first defined on the World Wide Web as documents or files identified by their URLs. However, today they have a much more generic and abstract definition that encompasses everything or entity that can be identified, named, addressed, or handled, in any way whatsoever, on the web. In a RESTful web service, requests made to a resource's URI will elicit a response that may be in HTML, XML, JSON, or some other format. The response may confirm that some alteration has been made to the stored resource, and the response may provide hypertext links to other related resources or collections of resources. When HTTP is used, as is most common, the operations available are GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and other predefined CRUD HTTP methods. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
By using a stateless protocol and standard operations, REST systems aim <span style="color: rgb(123,0,82);">for</span> fast performance, reliability, and the ability to grow, by re-using components that can be managed and updated without affecting the system as a whole, even while it is running. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>A coaxial RF connector (radio frequency connector) is an electrical connector designed to work at radio frequencies in the multi-megahertz range. RF connectors are typically used with coaxial cables and are designed to maintain the shielding that the coaxial design offers. Better models also minimize the change in transmission line impedance at the connection in order to reduce signal reflection and power loss. As the frequency increases, transmission line effects become more important, with small impedance variations from connectors causing the signal to reflect rather than pass through. An RF connector must not allow external signals into the circuit through electromagnetic interference and capacitive pickup. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Mechanically, RF connectors may provide a fastening mechanism (thread, bayonet, braces, blind mate) and springs for a low ohmic electric contact while sparing the gold surface, thus allowing very high mating cycles and reducing the insertion force. Research activity in the area of radio-frequency (RF) circuit design has surged in the 2000s in direct response to the enormous market demand for inexpensive, high-data-rate wireless transceivers. <span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="plugins/servlet/confluence/placeholder/unknown-attachment" title="worddav5ace6a75721c51dcca734d64220d0cc9.png"></span> <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  </p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Routing Information Protocol</p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>The Routing Information Protocol (RIP) is one of the oldest distance-vector routing protocols which employ the hop count as a routing metric. RIP prevents routing loops by implementing a limit on the number of hops allowed in a path from source to destination. The largest number of hops allowed for RIP is 15, which limits the size of networks that RIP can support. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
RIP implements the split horizon, route poisoning and holddown mechanisms to prevent incorrect routing information from being propagated. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
In RIPv1 router broadcast updates with their routing table every 30 seconds. In the early deployments, routing tables were small enough that the traffic was not significant. As networks grew in size, however, it became evident there could be a massive traffic burst every 30 seconds, even if the routers had been initialized at random times. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
In most networking environments, RIP is not the preferred choice for routing as its time to converge and scalability are poor compared to EIGRP, OSPF, or IS-IS. However, it is easy to configure, because RIP does not require any parameters unlike other protocols. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
RIP uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) as its transport protocol, and is assigned the reserved port number 520.</p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>A risk-reward analysis is a very simple tool which can help you assess the risk and reward profile of completely different options. It works in the same way as a risk-return analysis which you may already be familiar with. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
It can be applied at any level, for example: <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></p>
<ul>
	<li>by a CEO for comparing different strategic directions for the company. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></li>
	<li>by a program manager deciding which projects to keep within the program and which to discard. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></li>
	<li>by a project manager deciding how to sequence tasks <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></li>
	<li>or simply by an individual team member deciding how best to spend their day. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
 <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
The template works by having risk plotted along one axis and reward along the other. In the diagram below I've divided the template into four sections to show you how to interpret the information. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
 <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
<span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="223" width="215" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008852/15008883.png?width=215" data-image-src="attachments/15008852/15008883.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008883" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav7db851cf6f01e39b978265ce02ea54bc.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008852" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" data-media-id="6e31febb-f63e-4775-b930-1bbf65a0a571" data-media-type="file"></span> <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
The four categories from the diagram above are as follows: <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
 <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Equal Low: where risk and reward are both proportional and low. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Equal High: where risk and reward are both proportional and high. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Positive: represents a positive risk-reward balance, where a higher return can be achieved with limited risk. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Negative: represents a negative risk-reward balance, where a low return is the reward for taking on a relatively high risk. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
How to Use it <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
First, you need to create a list of all the different options and their possible rewards. This can done quickly and roughly, or can involve serious effort (market research, scenario development etc) – the effort you put in will depend on the size of the decision you are making. Examples of some options might include: outsourcing non-core activities, stop investing in poorly performing product lines, invest in new products, or investing to move into new markets. Once you have all the options and their potential reward, they should be plotted on the risk-reward chart: <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
<span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="277" width="262" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008852/15008889.png?width=262" data-image-src="attachments/15008852/15008889.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008889" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddav0face5689f05053a1249d1d80b53a3bb.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008852" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" data-media-id="572e9ccc-62b5-4ac8-8ba6-a997f2b62927" data-media-type="file"></span> <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
At this stage some options will appear to have a more favourable risk-reward profile than others, such as outsourcing in the above example, but it is work taking the time to investigate whether any options can have their risks mitigated, or if there are options that can have their rewards boosted, before making a final decision on which option to go with. In the above example, if the risk of developing new products could be mitigated somehow then that option would become more favourable than outsourcing. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
 <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Finally, for an even more complete picture to further aid our decision making, we can add resources to the risk-reward template. In the diagram below, the bigger the bubble the more resources are required to execute that option. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
<span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="276" width="267" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008852/15008895.png?width=267" data-image-src="attachments/15008852/15008895.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008895" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddavd1fa2f39a32528b506aa34090dcdf9e1.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008852" data-linked-resource-container-version="1" data-media-id="eb3e2aa4-653a-4bc1-8120-5c9a25d2bec1" data-media-type="file"></span> <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
With risk, reward, and resources all plotted, we are able to trade them against one another to find the best option for us. From the diagram above you can see that outsourcing is probably the most favourable option, providing plenty of upside reward but requiring minimal resource and having little risk. Additionally, with so few resources engaged in making the outsourcing happen, perhaps some investigative work can start on the new product development option with some of the spare resource.</li>

Round-robin scheduling is simple, easy to implement, and starvation-free. Round-robin scheduling can also be applied to other scheduling problems, such as data packet scheduling in computer networks.

<td class="confluenceTd"><p> </p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>A router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks. Routers perform the traffic directing functions on the Internet. Data sent through the internet, such as a web page or email, is in the form of data packets. A packet is typically forwarded from one router to another router through the networks that constitute an internetwork until it reaches its destination node. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
A router is connected to two or more data lines from different networks. When a data packet comes in on one of the lines, the router reads the network address information in the packet to determine the ultimate destination. Then, using information in its routing table or routing policy, it directs the packet to the next network on its journey. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
The most familiar type of routers are home and small office routers that simply forward IP packets between the home computers and the Internet. An example of a router would be the owner's cable or DSL router, which connects to the Internet through an Internet service provider (ISP). More sophisticated routers, such as enterprise routers, connect large business or ISP networks up to the powerful core routers that forward data at high speed along the optical fiber lines of the Internet backbone. Though routers are typically dedicated hardware devices, software-based routers also exist</p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p> </p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>In distributed computing, a remote procedure call (RPC) is when a computer program causes a procedure (subroutine) to execute in a different address space (commonly on another computer on a shared network), which is coded as if it were a normal (local) procedure call, without the programmer explicitly coding the details for the remote interaction. That is, the programmer writes essentially the same code whether the subroutine is local to the executing program, or remote. This is a form of client–server interaction (caller is client, executor is server), typically implemented via a request–response message-passing system. In the object-oriented programming paradigm, RPC calls are represented by remote method invocation (RMI). The RPC model implies a level of location transparency, namely that calling procedures is largely the same whether it is local or remote, but usually they are not identical, so local calls can be distinguished from remote calls. Remote calls are usually orders of magnitude slower and less reliable than local calls, so distinguishing them is important. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
RPCs are a form of inter-process communication (IPC), in that different processes have different address spaces: if on the same host machine, they have distinct virtual address spaces, even though the physical address space is the same; while if they are on different hosts, the physical address space is different. Many different (often incompatible) technologies have been used to implement the concept.</p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Radio Resource Control</p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>The Radio Resource Control (RRC) protocol is used in UMTS and LTE on the Air interface. It is a layer that exists between UE and eNB and exists at the IP level. This protocol is specified by 3GPP in TS 25.331 for UMTS and in TS 36.331  for LTE. RRC messages are transported via the PDCP-Protocol. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
The major functions of the RRC protocol include connection establishment and release functions, broadcast of system information, radio bearer establishment, reconfiguration and release, RRC connection mobility procedures, paging notification and release and outer loop power control. By means of the signalling functions the RRC configures the user and control planes according to the network status and allows for Radio Resource Management strategies to be implemented. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
The operation of the RRC is guided by a state machine which defines certain specific states that a UE may be present in. The different states in this state machine have different amounts of radio resources associated with them and these are the resources that the UE may use when it is present in a given specific state. Since different amounts of resources are available at different states the quality of the service that the user experiences and the energy consumption of the UE are influenced by this state machine. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
In order to comprehend the Radio Resource Control (RRC) state machine, we should study the architecture of the third generation mobile cellular system, the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The UMTS is composed by two subsystems, the UTRAN (Umts Terrestrial Radio Access Network) and CN (core network) : <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

The RNC is responsible for the packet scheduling, radio resource control and handover control. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Unlike other wireless technologies like WIFI in which clients concurrently send packets and collisions occur (and backoff algorithms), in the UMTS there is a centralized entity that schedules resources to each client. In order to manage the UE access to radio resources, the UMTS introduces a radio resource control protocol (RRC) that attributes each UE a specific state machine (based on radio resource usage). This state machine is dependent on the 3G provider and can have different states and/or transitions. According to the reference paper – Characterizing Radio Resource Allocation for 3G Networks – the studied networks were composed by three states: IDLE, CELL_FACH and CELL_DCH. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
In truth other states can actually be observed in some operators before going into a disconnected mode. For example the PCH states – URA_PCH and CELL_PCH – are states in which the user equipment has no transport channels allocated but has to monitor the cell/UTRAN it is currently connected to in order to send CELL_UPDATES to the RCN (just in case it actually changes). This update implies temporarily changing the state to a CELL_FACH in order to be able to send data. The change from CELL_PCH, in which the UE is known at a cell level, to URA_PCH, in which the user is known at UTRAN level, may be due to an increasing number of CELL_UPDATES (e.g. travelling fast). This is useful in order to speed up incoming connections since it might take around 0.9 seconds to establish it against the 2.5s delay if the UE is on the IDLE state. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Below is a diagram that represents the six most common states – CELL_DCH, CELL_FACH, CELL_PCH, URA_PCH, IDLE, DISCONNECT – and some of the possible transitions. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Resource Reservation Protocol</p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>The Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) is a transport layer protocol designed to reserve resources across a network for quality of service (QoS) using the integrated services model. RSVP operates over an IPv4 or IPv6 and provides receiver-initiated setup of resource reservations for multicast or unicast data flows. It does not transport application data but is similar to a control protocol, like Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) or Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP). RSVP is described in RFC 2205. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
RSVP can be used by hosts and routers to request or deliver specific levels of QoS for application data streams or flows. RSVP defines how applications place reservations and how they can relinquish the reserved resources once no longer required. RSVP operation will generally result in resources being reserved in each node along a path. RSVP is not a routing protocol and was designed to interoperate with current and future routing protocols. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
RSVP by itself is rarely deployed in telecommunications networks today[citation needed] but, as of February 2003, the traffic engineering extension of RSVP, or RSVP-TE, is becoming more widely accepted nowadays in many QoS-oriented networks. Next Steps in Signaling (NSIS) is a proposed replacement for RSVP.</p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p> </p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>A real-time operating system (RTOS) is an operating system (OS) intended to serve real-time applications that process data as it comes in, typically without buffer delays. Processing time requirements (including any OS delay) are measured in tenths of seconds or shorter increments of time. A real time system is a time bound system which has well defined fixed time constraints. Processing must be done within the defined constraints or the system will fail. They either are event driven or time sharing. Event driven systems switch between tasks based on their priorities while time sharing systems switch the task based on clock interrupts. Most RTOS's use a pre-emptive scheduling algorithm. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
A key characteristic of an RTOS is the level of its consistency concerning the amount of time it takes to accept and complete an application's task; the variability is jitter. A hard real-time operating system has less jitter than a soft real-time operating system. The chief design goal is not high throughput, but rather a guarantee of a soft or hard performance category. An RTOS that can usually or generally meet a deadline is a soft real-time OS, but if it can meet a deadline deterministically it is a hard real-time OS. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
An RTOS has an advanced algorithm for scheduling. Scheduler flexibility enables a wider, computer-system orchestration of process priorities, but a real-time OS is more frequently dedicated to a narrow set of applications. Key factors in a real-time OS are minimal interrupt latency and minimal thread switching latency; a real-time OS is valued more for how quickly or how predictably it can respond than for the amount of work it can perform in a given period of time.</p></td>
