X.509 certificates are used in many Internet protocols, including TLS/SSL, which is the basis for HTTPS, the secure protocol for browsing the web. They are also used in offline applications, like electronic signatures.</p><p>An X.509 certificate binds an identity to a public key using a digital signature. A certificate contains an identity (a hostname, or an organization, or an individual) and a public key (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, ed25519, etc.), and is either signed by a certificate authority or is self-signed. When a certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority, or validated by other means, someone holding that certificate can use the public key it contains to establish secure communications with another party, or validate documents digitally signed by the corresponding private key.</p><p>X.509 also defines certificate revocation lists, which are a means to distribute information about certificates that have been deemed invalid by a signing authority, as well as a certification path validation algorithm, which allows for certificates to be signed by intermediate CA certificates, which are, in turn, signed by other certificates, eventually reaching a trust anchor.</p><p>X.509 is defined by the International Telecommunications Union's &quot;Standardization Sector&quot; (ITU-T), in ITU-T Study Group 17 and is based on ASN.1, another ITU-T standard.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><div class="content-wrapper"><h1 id="X-XML">XML</h1></div></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Extensible Markup Language</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>In computing, Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. The W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and several other related specifications—all of them free open standards—define XML. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality, and usability across the Internet.[5] It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, the language is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while programmers have developed many application programming interfaces (APIs) to aid the processing of XML data. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>&lt;note&gt; <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>&lt;to&gt;Tove&lt;/to&gt; <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>&lt;from&gt;Jani&lt;/from&gt; <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>&lt;heading&gt;Reminder&lt;/heading&gt; <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>&lt;body&gt;Don't forget me this weekend!&lt;/body&gt; <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>&lt;/note&gt; <br class="atl-forced-newline"/> </p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><div class="content-wrapper"><h1 id="X-XMLSchema">XML Schema</h1></div></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p><br/></p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>An XML schema is a description of a type of XML document, typically expressed in terms of constraints on the structure and content of documents of that type, above and beyond the basic syntactical constraints imposed by XML itself. These constraints are generally expressed using some combination of grammatical rules governing the order of elements, Boolean predicates that the content must satisfy, data types governing the content of elements and attributes, and more specialized rules such as uniqueness and referential integrity constraints. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>There are languages developed specifically to express XML schemas. The Document Type Definition (DTD) language, which is native to the XML specification, is a schema language that is of relatively limited capability, but that also has other uses in XML aside from the expression of schemas. Two more expressive XML schema languages in widespread use are XML Schema (with a capital S) and RELAX NG. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>The mechanism for associating an XML document with a schema varies according to the schema language.

It enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data between any two or more network entities. Originally named Jabber, the protocol was developed by the Jabber open-source community in 1999 for near real-time instant messaging (IM), presence information, and contact list maintenance. Designed to be extensible, the protocol has been used also for publish-subscribe systems, signalling for VoIP, video, file transfer, gaming, the Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as the smart grid, and social networking services. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>Unlike most instant messaging protocols, XMPP is defined in an open standard and uses an open systems approach of development and application, by which anyone may implement an XMPP service and interoperate with other organizations' implementations. Because XMPP is an open protocol, implementations can be developed using any software license and many server, client, and library implementations are distributed as free and open-source software, numerous freeware and commercial software implementations also exist. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) formed an XMPP working group in 2002 to formalize the core protocols as an IETF instant messaging and presence technology. The XMPP Working group produced four specifications (RFC 3920, RFC 3921, RFC 3922, RFC 3923), which were approved as Proposed Standards in 2004. In 2011, RFC 3920 and RFC 3921 were superseded by RFC 6120 and RFC 6121 respectively, with RFC 6122 specifying the XMPP address format. In 2015, RFC 6122 was superseded by RFC 7622. In addition to these core protocols standardized at the IETF, the XMPP Standards Foundation (formerly the Jabber Software Foundation) is active in developing open XMPP extensions.</p></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><div class="content-wrapper"><h1 id="X-XP">XP</h1></div></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>eXtreme Programming</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Programming Extreme Programming (XP) is an agile software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software, and higher quality of life for the development team.

However, unlike most other schema languages, XSD was also designed with the intent that determination of a document's validity would produce a collection of information adhering to specific data types.

A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. Cross-site scripting carried out on websites accounted for roughly 84% of all security vulnerabilities documented by Symantec as of 2007. Bug bounty company HackerOne in 2017 reported that XSS is still a major threat vector. XSS effects vary in range from petty nuisance to significant security risk, depending on the sensitivity of the data handled by the vulnerable site and the nature of any security mitigation implemented by the site's owner.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>
