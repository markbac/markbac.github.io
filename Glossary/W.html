  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Business, education and government entities use wide area networks to relay data to staff, students, clients, buyers, and suppliers from various locations across the world. In essence, this mode of telecommunication allows a business to effectively carry out its daily function regardless of location. The Internet may be considered a WAN. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Wireless ad hoc network</p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>A wireless ad hoc network (WANET) or MANET (Mobile ad hoc network) is a decentralised type of wireless network. The network is ad hoc because it does not rely on a pre-existing infrastructure, such as routers in wired networks or access points in managed (infrastructure) wireless networks. Instead, each node participates in routing by forwarding data for other nodes, so the determination of which nodes forward data is made dynamically on the basis of network connectivity and the routing algorithm in use. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
In the Windows operating system, ad-hoc is a communication mode (setting) that allows computers to directly communicate with each other without a router.  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Wireless mobile ad hoc networks are self-configuring, dynamic networks in which nodes are free to move. Wireless networks lack the complexities of infrastructure setup and administration, enabling devices to create and join networks &quot;on the fly&quot; – anywhere, anytime.</p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>The waterfall model is a relatively linear sequential design approach for certain areas of engineering design. In software development, it tends to be among the less iterative and flexible approaches, as progress flows in largely one direction (&quot;downwards&quot; like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, deployment and maintenance. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
The waterfall development model originated in the manufacturing and construction industries; where the highly structured physical environments meant that design changes became prohibitively expensive much sooner in the development process. When first adopted for software development, there were no recognized alternatives for knowledge-based creative work <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
 <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
The Waterfall methodology came about by mistake due to a misunderstanding a 1970 paper which gave it as an example of a methodology along with a comment that states this is a risky method and invites failure. A US Department of Defense standard was published in 1985 with a methodology based on the 1970 paper and it then became widespread. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

In the same way that the vanilla WBC product could be seen as a replacement for DataStream, WBMC can be seen as a replacement for IPStream. This product is an end-to-end product, encompassing the EUA (End User Access), presence at the APs (Aggregation Points), EPs (Extension Paths) and an MSIL (Although the MSIL is purchased separately by the ISP). Ultimately this saves the ISP having to manage and maintain presence at the 20 WBC nodes (APs), which would involve considerable initial outlay and ongoing investment. The backhaul is also managed by BT entirely. On the other side of the coin this means the ISP is locked in to a BT platform - which may not necessarily be the cheapest - and it certainly does not offer all of the flexibility that an ISP using WBC would receive. That said, all of the same products and QoS options are available on WBMC as on WBC.</p></td>

W-CDMA uses the DS-CDMA channel access method with a pair of 5 MHz wide channels. In contrast, the competing CDMA2000 system uses one or more available 1.25 MHz channels for each direction of communication. W-CDMA systems are widely criticized for their large spectrum usage, which delayed deployment in countries that acted relatively slowly in allocating new frequencies specifically for 3G services (such as the United States).</p></td>

WEP, recognizable by its key of 10 or 26 hexadecimal digits (40 or 104 bits), was at one time widely in use and was often the first security choice presented to users by router configuration tools. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

Devices that can use Wi-Fi technology include desktops and laptops, video game consoles, smartphones and tablets, smart TVs, digital audio players and modern printers. Wi-Fi compatible devices can connect to the Internet via a WLAN and a wireless access point. Such an access point (or hotspot) has a range of about 20 meters (66 feet) indoors and a greater range outdoors. Hotspot coverage can be as small as a single room with walls that block radio waves, or as large as many square kilometres achieved by using multiple overlapping access points. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

Wi-Fi most commonly uses the 2.4 gigahertz (12 cm) UHF and 5.8 gigahertz (5 cm) SHF ISM radio bands, these bands are subdivided into multiple channels. Each channel can be time-shared by multiple networks. These wavelengths work best for line-of-sight. Many common materials absorb or reflect them, which further restricts range, but can tend to help minimise interference between different networks in crowded environments. At close range, some versions of Wi-Fi, running on suitable hardware[disambiguation needed] can achieve speeds of over 1 Gbps. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Anyone within range with a wireless network interface controller can attempt to access a network; because of this, Wi-Fi is more vulnerable to attack (called eavesdropping) than wired networks. Wi-Fi Protected Access is a family of technologies created to protect information moving across Wi-Fi networks and includes solutions for personal and enterprise networks. Security features of Wi-Fi Protected Access have included stronger protections and new security practices as the security landscape has changed over time.</p></td>

WIN-T INCREMENT 1: COMMUNICATIONS AT-THE-HALT <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Originally known as the Joint Network Node Network (JNN-N) program, WIN-T Increment 1 (Inc. 1) began fielding in 2004 to support combat missions during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
With WIN-T Inc. 1, for the first time in history, the soldiers on the battlefield had a high-speed, interoperable voice and data communications network at the battalion level. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
WIN-T INCREMENT 2: COMMUNICATIONS ON-THE-MOVE <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
The Army's 10th Mountain Division was the first to field WIN-T Inc. 2 new capabilities when they deployed for Afghanistan in July 2013. WIN-T Inc. 2's unique value was immediately recognized, as it provided soldiers with communications even as fixed infrastructure was removed. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
The Tactical Communication Nodes in Inc. 2 took the first step in providing a mobile infrastructure on the battlefield. This includes mobile Point Of Presence systems (installed on select vehicles at battalion levels and above, which include four companies of up to 200 soldiers and about 10 to 30 vehicles each), vehicle wireless packages, and the Soldier Network Extension (for Company-level connectivity). <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Increment 2 enables mission command from brigade to division to company through a completely ad-hoc, self-forming network. Commanders and select staff now have the ability to maneuver anywhere on the battlefield and maintain connectivity to the network, without the need to stop and set up communications, making them vulnerable to attack. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>

A wireless mesh network (WMN) is a communications network made up of radio nodes organized in a mesh topology. It is also a form of wireless ad hoc network. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
A mesh refers to rich interconnection among devices or nodes. Wireless mesh networks often consist of mesh clients, mesh routers and gateways. Mobility of nodes is less frequent. If nodes were to constantly or frequently move, the mesh will spend more time updating routes than delivering data. In a wireless mesh network, topology tends to be more static, so that routes computation can converge and delivery of data to their destinations can occur. Hence, this is a low-mobility centralized form of wireless ad hoc network. Also, because it sometimes relies on static nodes to act as gateways, it is not a truly all-wireless ad hoc network. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
The mesh clients are often laptops, cell phones and other wireless devices while the mesh routers forward traffic to and from the gateways which may, but need not, be connected to the Internet. The coverage area of the radio nodes working as a single network is sometimes called a mesh cloud. Access to this mesh cloud is dependent on the radio nodes working in harmony with each other to create a radio network. A mesh network is reliable and offers redundancy. When one node can no longer operate, the rest of the nodes can still communicate with each other, directly or through one or more intermediate nodes. Wireless mesh networks can self form and self heal. Wireless mesh networks work with different wireless technologies including 802.11, 802.15, 802.16, cellular technologies and need not be restricted to any one technology or protocol.</p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>A wireless repeater (also called wireless range extender) takes an existing signal from a wireless router or wireless access point and rebroadcasts it to create a second network. When two or more hosts have to be connected with one another over the IEEE 802.11 protocol and the distance is too long for a direct connection to be established, a wireless repeater is used to bridge the gap. It can be a specialized stand alone computer networking device. Also, some Wireless network interface controllers (WNIC)s optionally support operating in such a mode. Those outside of the primary network will be able to connect through the new &quot;repeated&quot; network. However, as far as the original router or access point is concerned, only the repeater MAC is connected, making it necessary to enable safety features on the wireless repeater. Wireless repeaters are commonly used to improve signal range and strength within homes and small offices.</p></td>
