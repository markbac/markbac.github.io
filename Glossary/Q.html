<td class="confluenceTd"><p> </p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>ITU-T Recommendation Q.931 is the ITU standard ISDN connection control signalling protocol, forming part of Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 1. Unlike connectionless systems like UDP, ISDN is connection oriented and uses explicit signalling to manage call state: Q.931. Q.931 typically does not carry user data. Q.931 does not have a direct equivalent in the Internet Protocol stack, but can be compared to SIP. Q.931 does not provide flow control or perform retransmission, since the underlying layers are assumed to be reliable and the circuit-oriented nature of ISDN allocates bandwidth in fixed increments of 64 kbit/s. Amongst other things, Q.931 manages connection setup and breakdown. Like TCP, Q.931 documents both the protocol itself and a protocol state machine. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Q.931 was designed for ISDN call establishment, maintenance, and release of network connections between two DTEs on the ISDN D channel. Q.931 has more recently been used as part of the VoIP H.323 protocol stack (see H.225.0) and in modified form in some mobile phone transmission systems and in ATM. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
A Q.931 frame contains the following elements: <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></p>
<ul>
	<li>Protocol discriminator (PD) – Specifies which signaling protocol is used for the connection (e.g. PD=8 for DSS1) <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></li>
	<li>Call reference value (CR) – Addresses different connections which can exist simultaneously. The value is valid only during the actual time period of the connection <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></li>
	<li>Message type (MT) – Specifies the type of a layer 3 message out of the Q.931-defined Message type set for call control (e.g. SETUP). There are messages defined for the call setup, the call release and the control of call features. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/></li>
	<li>Information elements (IE) – Specify further information which is associated to the actual message. An IE contains the IE name (e.g. bearer capability), their length and a variable field of contents.</li>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Quadrature Amplitude Modulation</p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) is the name of a family of digital modulation methods and a related family of analog modulation methods widely used in modern telecommunications to transmit information. It conveys two analog message signals, or two digital bit streams, by changing (modulating) the amplitudes of two carrier waves, using the amplitude-shift keying (ASK) digital modulation scheme or amplitude modulation (AM) analog modulation scheme. The two carrier waves of the same frequency are out of phase with each other by 90°, a condition known as orthogonality or quadrature. The transmitted signal is created by adding the two carrier waves together. At the receiver, the two waves can be coherently separated (demodulated) because of their orthogonality property. Another key property is that the modulations are low-frequency/low-bandwidth waveforms compared to the carrier frequency, which is known as the narrowband assumption. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Phase modulation (analog PM) and phase-shift keying (digital PSK) can be regarded as a special case of QAM, where the amplitude of the transmitted signal is a constant, but its phase varies. This can also be extended to frequency modulation (FM) and frequency-shift keying (FSK), for these can be regarded as a special case of phase modulation. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
QAM is used extensively as a modulation scheme for digital telecommunication systems, such as in 802.11 Wi-Fi standards. Arbitrarily high spectral efficiencies can be achieved with QAM by setting a suitable constellation size, limited only by the noise level and linearity of the communications channel.  QAM is being used in optical fiber systems as bit rates increase; QAM16 and QAM64 can be optically emulated with a 3-path interferometer.</p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Quality of Service</p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Quality of service (QoS) is the description or measurement of the overall performance of a service, such as a telephony or computer network or a cloud computing service, particularly the performance seen by the users of the network. To quantitatively measure quality of service, several related aspects of the network service are often considered, such as packet loss, bit rate, throughput, transmission delay, availability, jitter, etc. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
In the field of computer networking and other packet-switched telecommunication networks, quality of service refers to traffic prioritization and resource reservation control mechanisms rather than the achieved service quality. Quality of service is the ability to provide different priority to different applications, users, or data flows, or to guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Quality of service is particularly important for the transport of traffic with special requirements. In particular, developers have introduced Voice over IP technology to allow computer networks to become as useful as telephone networks for audio conversations, as well as supporting new applications with even stricter network performance requirements.</p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p> </p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>QSIG is an ISDN based signaling protocol for signaling between private branch exchanges (PBXs) in a private integrated services network (PISN). It makes use of the connection-level Q.931 protocol and the application-level ROSE protocol. ISDN &quot;proper&quot; functions as the physical link layer. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
QSIG was originally developed by Ecma International, adopted by ETSI and is defined by a set of ISO standard documents, so is not owned by any company. This allows interoperability between communications platforms provided by disparate vendors. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
QSIG has two layers, called BC (basic call) and GF (generic function). QSIG BC describes how to set up calls between PBXs. QSIG GF provides supplementary services for large-scale corporate, educational, and government networks, such as line identification, call intrusion and call forwarding. Thus for a large or very distributed company that requires multiple PBXs, users can receive the same services across the network and be unaware of the switch that their telephone is connected to. This greatly eases the problems of management of large networks.</p></td>
