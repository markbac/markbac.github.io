<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of &quot;objects&quot;, which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of &quot;this&quot; or &quot;self&quot;). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another. There is significant diversity of OOP languages, but the most popular ones are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determine their type. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Many of the most widely-used programming languages (such as C+<span style="text-decoration: underline;">, Object Pascal, Java, Python etc.) are multi-paradigm programming languages that support object-oriented programming to a greater or lesser degree, typically in combination with imperative, procedural programming. Significant object-oriented languages include Java, C</span>+, C#, Python, PHP, Ruby, Perl, Object Pascal, Objective-C, Dart, Swift, Scala, Common Lisp, and Smalltalk.</p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p> </p></td>
<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Opus is a lossy audio coding format developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation and standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force, designed to efficiently code speech and general audio in a single format, while remaining low-latency enough for real-time interactive communication and low-complexity enough for low-end embedded processors. Opus replaces both Vorbis and Speex for new applications, and several blind listening tests have ranked it higher-quality than any other standard audio format at any given bitrate until transparency is reached, including MP3, AAC, and HE-AAC. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Opus combines the speech-oriented linear predictive coding SILK algorithm and the lower-latency, MDCT-based CELT algorithm, switching between or combining them as needed for maximal efficiency. Bitrate, audio bandwidth, complexity, and algorithm can all be adjusted seamlessly in each frame. Opus has the low algorithmic delay (26.5 ms by default) necessary for use as part of a real-time communication link, permitting natural conversation, networked music performances, and live lip sync; by trading-off quality or bitrate, the delay can be reduced down to 5 ms. Its delay is exceptionally low compared to competing codecs, which require well over 100 ms, yet Opus performs very competitively with these formats in terms of quality per bitrate</p></td>

<td class="confluenceTd"><p>Overlap dialing is required by CAS signaled lines. Overlap dial provides for a longer time-out period between digits, also called the inter-digit timer. With overlap dial set to off, the gateway expects to receive the digits one right after the other coming in to this line with very little delay between digits. With overlap dial set to on, then the device waits up to about 2 seconds between digits. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
Basically overlap dialing is a mechanism where a destination number can be specified partially to complete the first stage of a routing path. For example, if the number was &quot;23168104&quot;, it may be possible for the telecom to dial &quot;23168&quot; to reach the first port of call as quickly as possible (to save time on sending the remaining 3 digits) and then deliver the remaining 3 digits &quot;104&quot; in overlap mode.</p></td>
