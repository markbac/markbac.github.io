The technique was originally used as a shortcut to avoid the need to readdress every host when a network was moved. It has become a popular and essential tool in conserving global address space in the face of IPv4 address exhaustion. One Internet-routable IP address of a NAT gateway can be used for an entire private network. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>IP masquerading is a technique that hides an entire IP address space, usually consisting of private IP addresses, behind a single IP address in another, usually public address space. The address that has to be hidden is changed into a single (public) IP address as &quot;new&quot; source address of the outgoing IP packet so it appears as originating not from the hidden host but from the routing device itself. Because of the popularity of this technique to conserve IPv4 address space, the term NAT has become virtually synonymous with IP masquerading. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>As network address translation modifies the IP address information in packets, it has serious consequences on the quality of Internet connectivity and requires careful attention to the details of its implementation.

It is an application of graph theory[4] wherein communicating devices are modeled as nodes and the connections between the devices are modeled as links or lines between the nodes. Physical topology is the placement of the various components of a network (e.g., device location and cable installation), while logical topology illustrates how data flows within a network. Distances between nodes, physical interconnections, transmission rates, or signal types may differ between two different networks, yet their topologies may be identical. A network's physical topology is a particular concern of the physical layer of the OSI model. Network topology can be used to define or describe the arrangement of various types of telecommunication networks, including command and control radio networks,[4] industrial fieldbusses, and computer networks. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>Examples of network typologies are found in local area networks (LAN), a common computer network installation. Any given node in the LAN has one or more physical links to other devices in the network; graphically mapping these links results in a geometric shape that can be used to describe the physical topology of the network. A wide variety of physical topologies have been used in LANs, including ring, bus, mesh and star. Conversely, mapping the data flow between the components determines the logical topology of the network. In comparison, Controller Area Networks, common in vehicles, are primarily distributed control system networks of one or more controllers interconnected with sensors and actuators over, invariably, a physical bus topology. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper confluence-embedded-manual-size"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" height="239" width="488" loading="lazy" src="attachments/15008662/15008675.png?width=488" data-image-src="attachments/15008662/15008675.png" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="15008675" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="worddavdf81d36e9dc2c10600521ec3a76697d6.png" data-base-url="https://texecom.atlassian.net/wiki" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/png" data-linked-resource-container-id="15008662" data-linked-resource-container-version="2" data-media-id="fb3dfcec-b014-4b6d-ba9e-96eb6ecb86cd" data-media-type="file"></span> <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/> </p></div></td></tr><tr><td class="confluenceTd"><div class="content-wrapper"><h1 id="N-_Toc14450471_Toc87515386NFS"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="N-_Toc14450471"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc14450471"></span></span><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="N-_Toc87515386"><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="_Toc87515386"></span></span>NFS</h1></div></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Network File System</p></td><td class="confluenceTd"><p>Network File System (NFS) is a distributed file system protocol originally developed by Sun Microsystems in 1984, allowing a user on a client computer to access files over a computer network much like local storage is accessed.

The general idea behind the NGN is that one network transports all information and services (voice, data, and all sorts of media such as video) by encapsulating these into IP packets, similar to those used on the Internet. NGNs are commonly built around the Internet Protocol, and therefore the term all IP is also sometimes used to describe the transformation of formerly telephone-centric networks toward NGN. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>According to ITU-T, the definition is: <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>A next-generation network (NGN) is a packet-based network which can provide services including Telecommunication Services and is able to make use of multiple broadband, quality of Service-enabled transport technologies and in which service-related functions are independent from underlying transport-related technologies. It offers unrestricted access by users to different service providers. It supports generalized mobility which will allow consistent and ubiquitous provision of services to users. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>From a practical perspective, NGN involves three main architectural changes that need to be looked at separately: </p><ul><li>In the core network, NGN implies a consolidation of several (dedicated or overlay) transport networks each historically built for a different service into one core transport network (often based on IP and Ethernet). It implies amongst others the migration of voice from a circuit-switched architecture (PSTN) to VoIP, and also migration of legacy services such as X.25, frame relay (either commercial migration of the customer to a new service like IP VPN, or technical emigration by emulation of the &quot;legacy service&quot; on the NGN). </li><li>In the wired access network, NGN implies the migration from the dual system of legacy voice next to xDSL setup in local exchanges to a converged setup in which the DSLAMs integrate voice ports or VoIP, making it possible to remove the voice switching infrastructure from the exchange.[2] </li><li>In the cable access network, NGN convergence implies migration of constant bit rate voice to CableLabs PacketCable standards that provide VoIP and SIP services. Both services ride over DOCSIS as the cable data layer standard. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/><br class="atl-forced-newline"/>In an NGN, there is a more defined separation between the transport (connectivity) portion of the network and the services that run on top of that transport. This means that whenever a provider wants to enable a new service, they can do so by defining it directly at the service layer without considering the transport layer – i.e. services are independent of transport details. Increasingly applications, including voice, tend to be independent of the access network (de-layering of network and applications) and will reside more on end-user devices (phone, PC, set-top box). <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>Underlying technology components <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>Next-generation networks are based on Internet technologies including Internet Protocol (IP) and multiprotocol label switching (MPLS). At the application level, Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) seems to be taking over from ITU-T H.323. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>Initially H.323 was the most popular protocol, though its popularity decreased in the &quot;local loop&quot; due to its original poor traversal of network address translation (NAT) and firewalls. For this reason as domestic VoIP services have been developed, SIP has been more widely adopted. However, in voice networks where everything is under the control of the network operator or telco, many of the largest carriers use H.323 as the protocol of choice in their core backbones.[citation needed] With the most recent changes introduced for H.323, it is now possible for H.323 devices to easily and consistently traverse NAT and firewall devices, opening up the possibility that H.323 may again be looked upon more favorably in cases where such devices encumbered its use previously. Nonetheless, most of the telcos are extensively researching and supporting IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS), which gives SIP a major chance of being the most widely adopted protocol. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>For voice applications one of the most important devices in NGN is a Softswitch – a programmable device that controls Voice over IP (VoIP) calls. It enables correct integration of different protocols within NGN. The most important function of the Softswitch is creating the interface to the existing telephone network, PSTN, through Signalling Gateways and Media Gateways. However, the Softswitch as a term may be defined differently by the different equipment manufacturers and have somewhat different functions. <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>One may quite often find the term Gatekeeper in NGN literature. This was originally a VoIP device, which converted (using gateways) voice and data from their analog or digital switched-circuit form (PSTN, SS7) to the packet-based one (IP). It controlled one or more gateways.

In case of Back-to-Back, VRF is necessary to create VLANs and subsequently sub-interfaces (VLAN headers and DLCI headers for Ethernet and frame relay network packets) on each interface used for the NNI circuit. In the case of eBGP NNI interconnection, P routers are taught how to dynamically exchange VRF records without VLAN creation. NNI also can be used for interconnection of two VoIP nodes.

Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the &quot;NoSQL&quot; moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications.

The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL.

Barriers to the greater adoption of NoSQL stores include the use of low-level query languages (instead of SQL, <span style="color: rgb(123,0,82);">for</span> instance the lack of ability to perform ad-hoc joins across tables), lack of standardized interfaces, and huge previous investments in existing relational databases.[ Most NoSQL stores lack true ACID transactions, although a few databases, such as MarkLogic, Aerospike, FairCom c-treeACE, Google Spanner (though technically a NewSQL database), Symas LMDB, and OrientDB have made them central to their designs. (See ACID and join support.) <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>  <br class="atl-forced-newline"/>Instead, most NoSQL databases offer a concept of &quot;eventual consistency&quot; in which database changes are propagated to all nodes &quot;eventually&quot; (typically within milliseconds) so queries <span style="color: rgb(123,0,82);">for</span> data might not return updated data immediately or might result in reading data that is not accurate, a problem known as stale reads.
