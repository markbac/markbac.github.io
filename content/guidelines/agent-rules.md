# Agent rules (condensed)

## How to use this file

Read this file at the start of every task, together with `AGENTS.md`. Rules cite IDs. Each section links to the full guideline, which is authoritative. If a rule conflicts with the task, stop and ask (GOV-09).

## Always

1. Follow `AGENTS.md` and the commands in it.
1. Make the smallest change that meets the requirement (CP-02, CP-16), and state assumptions and questions first (CP-20).
1. Write Conventional Commits with `Refs:` and `Assisted-by:` footers (VCS-03, VCS-05, AGT-06).
1. Work on a short-lived branch and open a PR. Never push to `main`, and never approve or merge your own work (AGT-04, PRR-06).
1. Add or update tests with the change. Never skip, delete or weaken a test or check to pass a gate (TST-15, PIP-08).
1. Run the full local check command before proposing a change and include the results (AGT-09).
1. Update documentation in the same change (DOC-04).
1. Propose significant or hard-to-reverse decisions as an ADR with status `proposed` (ADR-03).
1. Never put secrets or personal data in code, logs, commits or prompts (SEC-05, AGT-08).
1. Stay out of the agent boundaries unless the task says so: guidelines, `AGENTS.md`, pipeline definitions, CODEOWNERS, secrets and signing material, generated and vendored code, security-relevant code, shared history and certified items (AGT-05).
1. When a rule is silent or unclear, apply the principles in [principles.md](principles-catalogue.md), starting with its start-here list. If principles conflict, or the answer is not clear, stop and ask.
1. Rules marked *(core)* cannot be tailored. Follow the product's conformance profile for the rest.

## [EG-001 Guidelines governance](guidelines-governance.md)

- Do not edit anything in `docs/guidelines/` unless the task explicitly says so (AGT-05).
- Cite rules by ID.
- If a rule blocks the task, stop and ask rather than deviating (GOV-09).

## [EG-002 Engineering values and ways of working](values-and-ways-of-working.md)

- Prefer small, reviewable changes (VAL-11).
- Record decisions and assumptions in the PR or an ADR, not only in chat (VAL-06).
- Raise risks and doubts early and do not hide uncertainty (VAL-12).

## [EG-003 Quality policy and quality attributes](quality-policy-and-attributes.md)

- When a task involves a trade-off, use the project's ranked quality attributes and say which one you optimised (QUA-03).
- Write measurable acceptance criteria (environment, stimulus, response, measure) and not adjectives (QUA-04).

## [EG-004 Documentation as code and terminology](documentation-as-code.md)

- Update docs in the same change as the behaviour they describe (DOC-04).
- Never hand-edit generated docs (DOC-09).
- Draw diagrams as Mermaid text and avoid semicolons in labels because they break rendering.

- Do not send data to a tool that is not approved for its classification (AGT-08).

## [EG-006 Requirements and traceability](requirements-and-traceability.md)

- Before implementing, find the requirement ID or IDs the task serves and cite them in commits (`Refs: REQ-...`) and test names (REQ-06).
- If there is no requirement, say so and ask, or propose one for review (REQ-13).
- Never edit approved requirements without instruction, and flag the impact on tests and docs (REQ-09).

## [EG-007 Architecture principles](architecture-principles.md)

- Respect layering and dependency direction (AP-02) and keep third-party and hardware code behind our interfaces (AP-03).
