# Decision records: RFCs and ADRs

- **Owner:** Architecture group
- **Applies to:** All significant technical, process and guideline decisions
- **Enforcement:** Review, CI (format and link checks)
- **Related:** [EG-001](guidelines-governance.md), [EG-002](values-and-ways-of-working.md), [EG-004](documentation-as-code.md), [EG-007](architecture-principles.md)

> **Note:** Rules marked *(core)* apply to every product and cannot be tailored. Other rules, and all numeric values, are proposed defaults that a product may tailor in its conformance profile ([EG-001](guidelines-governance.md)).

## Purpose

Give significant proposals a structured, time-boxed and inclusive way to gather input across sites and disciplines (the RFC). Then record the outcome with its context, so that it is not re-litigated, misremembered or lost (the ADR).

## RFC or ADR?

The RFC is the discussion. The ADR is the outcome. Small decisions with an obvious owner go straight to an ADR. Anything with real disagreement, cross-team impact or a high cost of being wrong starts as an RFC, and produces one or more ADRs.

A decision needs an ADR if it is hard or costly to reverse, or affects more than one team or component. Examples are the choice of RTOS, bootloader, update mechanism, cryptographic scheme or flash layout, and an interface between components. Adopting or dropping a significant tool or dependency needs one too, as does a deviation from a guideline that is likely to recur.

## Rules

1. **ADR-01** *(core)* ADRs MUST be stored in `docs/adr/` in the repository they affect, numbered sequentially and named `NNNN-short-title.md`.
1. **ADR-02** ADRs MUST use the standard template (below).
1. **ADR-03** *(core)* An ADR MUST be proposed by PR. Merging with status `accepted` is the record of approval.
1. **ADR-04** *(core)* An accepted ADR MUST be immutable apart from status and links. A changed decision is a new ADR that supersedes the old one, and the old ADR MUST be updated to point to it.
1. **ADR-05** Each ADR MUST record at least two considered options, including "do nothing" where relevant, with reasons for rejection.
1. **ADR-06** Each ADR MUST state its consequences, including negative ones, and how the decision will be verified.
1. **ADR-07** ADRs SHOULD link to the requirements they satisfy, the principles that apply (PRN-01), the RFC that led to them, and the PRs that implement them. Implementing commits SHOULD carry an `ADR:` footer.
1. **ADR-08** ADRs SHOULD be written before or during implementation. Retrospective ADRs are acceptable for undocumented existing decisions and MUST be marked as such.
1. **ADR-09** A decision log index MUST be generated from ADR front matter.
1. **RFC-01** *(core)* An RFC MUST be used for new or changed guidelines, cross-team interface changes, adoption of major tools or dependencies, and changes to the release or update process.
1. **RFC-02** RFCs MUST be stored in `docs/rfc/`, numbered, and proposed by PR so that discussion is attached to the text.
1. **RFC-03** Each RFC MUST name an author, a sponsor with authority to decide, and the affected teams and sites.
1. **RFC-04** Each RFC MUST have a comment period of at least five working days (longer when several time zones are involved) and a stated decision date.
1. **RFC-05** Affected teams MUST be notified explicitly. Silence from a team that was not told is not consent.
1. **RFC-06** Each RFC MUST include: problem statement, goals and non-goals, proposal, alternatives, impact (including migration and cost), risks and open questions.
1. **RFC-07** The sponsor MUST record the outcome (`accepted`, `rejected`, `withdrawn`) with a short rationale and a summary of unresolved objections.
1. **RFC-08** An accepted RFC MUST result in one or more ADRs and, where relevant, guideline updates. The RFC then becomes read-only.
1. **RFC-09** RFCs SHOULD be short. A proposal that needs more than five pages should be split.
1. **RFC-10** Written comment is the default. Meetings are for resolving disagreements, and their outcomes MUST be written back to the RFC (VAL-06).
1. **RFC-11** The architecture group MUST run a forum on a fixed cadence (proposed: fortnightly) where open RFCs are decided. Every RFC has a decision date, and an RFC not decided by then MUST be decided, deferred with a written reason, or withdrawn.
1. **RFC-12** Architecture review MUST be limited to architecturally significant changes: a cross-component interface, an architecture principle, a quality attribute target, a component boundary or the adoption of a technology. Other decisions belong to the component owner (VAL-02).

## ADR template

## Context

What is the problem, and what forces (technical, regulatory, schedule) apply?

## Decision drivers

- Driver 1
- Driver 2

## Options considered

1. Option A: summary, pros, cons
1. Option B: summary, pros, cons

## Decision

We will do X, because Y.

## Consequences

- Positive:
- Negative:
- Follow-up actions:

## Verification

How will we know this decision is working?
```

## RFC lifecycle

  [*] --> Draft
  Draft --> InReview: PR opened
  InReview --> Accepted: Sponsor decides
  InReview --> Rejected: Sponsor decides
  InReview --> Withdrawn: Author withdraws
  Accepted --> Implemented: ADRs and work items created

## Compliance

| Rule | Checked by |
|------|------------|
| ADR-01, ADR-02, ADR-09 | CI: ADR front matter and heading validation, index generation |
| ADR-03, ADR-04 | Branch protection, CI: accepted ADR content immutability check |
| ADR-07, RFC-08 | Review, PR template item |
| RFC-11, RFC-12 | Forum calendar and decision log review |
| RFC-01 to RFC-07 | RFC template validation in CI, sponsor review |

## Applying to personal projects and AI agents

### Personal projects

Starts at the **Standard** profile (see [personal-projects.md](personal-projects.md)). Keep ADRs. They are your memory and your agents' memory. Replace RFCs with a short design note in `docs/rfc/` for large changes, with no comment period and you as sponsor.

### AI agents

- When a decision is significant, hard to reverse or crosses component boundaries, draft an ADR with status `proposed` from `docs/templates-reference/adr.md` instead of implementing silently (ADR-03).
- Do not edit accepted ADRs, supersede them (ADR-04).
- Read `docs/adr/` before changing behaviour it governs.
- Record at least two options (ADR-05).
