# Guidelines

## About these guidelines

These are 26 engineering guidelines for an embedded R&D function, one guideline per file. They work for one product or many, and do not assume that products share code. They describe the practices a mature team follows and, for each one, what the guideline must contain and how compliance is checked. They are not coding rules: those belong in the coding standard that [EG-013](coding-standard.md) requires.

Each guideline has rules with stable IDs, a compliance table, a checklist, and notes for applying it to personal projects and to AI agents. Cite rules by ID (for example `VCS-03`) in reviews, commits and agent instructions.

> **Note:** All guidelines are `draft` at version 0.1.0. Numeric thresholds (review turnaround, patch times, coverage targets, size limits) are proposed starting points. Set `status: active` when you adopt a guideline.

## Using these guidelines

- **In an organisation with several products:** read [organisation-adoption.md](organisation-adoption.md). Core rules apply everywhere, and each product records its tailoring in a conformance profile.
- **In a single team:** copy the guidelines and the [templates](../templates/index.md) you need into the repository's `docs/` folder, confirm the owner roles, and adopt in the order given below.
- **In a personal project:** read [personal-projects.md](personal-projects.md), pick a profile (Starter, Standard or Full) and follow the bootstrap steps.
- **With AI agents:** put an [`AGENTS.md`](../templates/agents-md.md) at the repository root and keep [agent-rules.md](agent-rules.md) in the repository. Each guideline also has an AI agents section.
- **To assess adoption:** use the checklist at the end of each guideline, or the combined [checklists.md](checklists.md).

## How to read the rules

The keywords MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT and MAY are used as defined in RFC 2119.

- **MUST**: mandatory. Deviation needs a recorded, approved exception.
- **SHOULD**: expected. Deviation needs a stated reason in the PR or ADR.
- **MAY**: optional and left to judgement.

Every rule has a stable ID (for example `DOC-03`). IDs are never reused. Reviews, commits, tooling output and AI agents cite rules by ID.

## Guiding principles for consistency

1. **GP-01 One way to do each thing.** Where two approaches exist, the guideline picks one and records why.
1. **GP-02 If a tool can check it, a tool checks it.** Reviewers spend attention on design, not formatting.
1. **GP-03 Conventions drive outcomes.** A convention that does not feed an automated result (version, changelog, trace report, release) is etiquette and will decay. Prefer conventions that machines can read.
1. **GP-04 Everything is text in version control.** Requirements, decisions, diagrams, pipelines, repository settings and guidelines are reviewed, versioned and diffable.
1. **GP-05 Record decisions once, at the right level.** Context in an RFC, outcome in an ADR, rules in a guideline, enforcement in tooling.
1. **GP-06 Local equals CI.** Any check that runs in the pipeline runs identically on a developer machine with one command.
1. **GP-07 Guidelines are short and owned.** A few pages each, one named owner, a review date, and a stated way of checking compliance.
1. **GP-08 Understand the tool.** Using a tool without knowing how it works (git, the linker, the RTOS, the debug probe) is a risk. Each guideline names the competence expected.
1. **GP-09 Explain the why.** Rules carry a rationale where it is not obvious, so that people and agents can apply them sensibly at the edges.
1. **GP-10 Sequence adoption.** Start with what other practices depend on: commit conventions, a single version source and a reproducible pipeline.

## Designing for AI agents

AI coding agents and assistants are treated as team members with no tribal knowledge, no memory between sessions, and perfect literalism. Every guideline is therefore written with explicit, numbered, testable rules and stable IDs, so that an agent can follow and cite them. Enforcement never depends on the agent complying: hooks, gates, branch protection and CODEOWNERS apply equally to agent-authored changes. The specific rules are in [EG-005](ai-agent-usage.md). The coding principles CP-02 (simplicity), CP-16 (surgical changes) and CP-20 (surface assumptions) in [EG-012](coding-principles.md) are the most important for agents.
