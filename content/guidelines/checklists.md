# Combined checklists

## How to use these checklists

Each guideline has its own checklist at the end of its file. This file combines them. Tick an item when it is true for your project.

- **Adoption:** the unticked items are what is left to set up.
- **Assessment:** the percentage ticked per guideline shows where you are strong or weak.
- **Review:** revisit before each release and at each guideline review.

For a personal project, use only the guidelines in your profile (see [personal-projects.md](personal-projects.md)). Copy a section into an issue or PR description to track it.

## [EG-025 Research, prototyping and experiments](research-and-prototyping.md)

Profile: Standard. Owner: Research lead.

- [ ] Work is classified as exploratory or production, with a question and a time-box (RSH-01)
- [ ] Exploratory code lives in designated locations and is excluded from release builds (RSH-02)
- [ ] Exemptions are understood and the non-negotiables are kept: no secrets, licences, data rules, version control, a working build (RSH-03)
- [ ] Prototype code is never copied into the product and the graduation checklist is used (RSH-04)
- [ ] An experiment record captures question, method, setup, results, conclusion and next step (RSH-05)
- [ ] Experiments are reproducible (RSH-06)
- [ ] Each exploration ends with a decision to stop, extend or graduate (RSH-07)
- [ ] The maturity level is stated (RSH-08)
- [ ] Prototypes are reviewed at the end of the time-box and unowned ones archived after 90 days (RSH-09)
- [ ] Lab equipment and boards are recorded with an owner (RSH-10)
- [ ] Findings are shared with the team (RSH-11)
- [ ] Agent use in prototypes follows the same boundaries (RSH-12)
